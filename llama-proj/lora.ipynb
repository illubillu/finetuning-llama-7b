      "Databases and database technology have had a major impact on the growing use of computers. It is fair to say that databases play a critical role in almost all areas where computers are used, including business, electronic commerce, social media, engi-neering, medicine, genetics, law, education, and library science. The word database is so commonly used that we must begin by defining what a database is. Our initial definition is quite general. A database  is a collection of related data. 1 By data , we mean known facts that can be recorded and that have implicit meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, consider the names, telephone numbers, and addresses of the people you know. Nowadays, this data is typically stored in mobile phones, which have their own simple database software. This data can also be recorded in an indexed address book or stored on a hard drive, using a personal computer and software such as Microsoft Access or Excel. This collection of related data with an implicit meaning is a database.\n",
      "\n",
      "The preceding definition of database is quite general; for example, we may consider the collection of words that make up this page of text to be related data and hence to 1We will use the word data as both singular and plural, as is common in database literature; the context will determine whether it is singular or plural. In standard English, data is used for plural and datum  for singular. 1.1 Introduction  5 constitute a database. However, the common use of the term database  is usually more restricted.\n",
      "\n",
      "A database has the following implicit properties: ■ A database represents some aspect of the real world, sometimes called the miniworld  or the universe of discourse (UoD) . Changes to the miniworld are reflected in the database. ■ A database is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning. A random assortment of data cannot correctly be referred to as a database. ■ A database is designed, built, and populated with data for a specific purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has an intended group of users and some preconceived applications in which these users are interested. In other words, a database has some source from which data is derived, some degree of interaction with events in the real world, and an audience that is actively inter-ested in its contents. The end users of a database may perform business transactions (for example, a customer buys a camera) or events may happen (for example, an employee has a baby) that cause the information in the database to change.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order for a database to be accurate and reliable at all times, it must be a true reflection of the miniworld that it represents; therefore, changes must be reflected in the data-base as soon as possible. A database can be of any size and complexity. For example, the list of names and addresses referred to earlier may consist of only a few hundred records, each with a simple structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, the computerized catalog of a large library may contain half a million entries organized under different categories—by pri- mary author’s last name, by subject, by book title—with each category organized alphabetically. A database of even greater size and complexity would be maintained by a social media company such as Facebook, which has more than a billion users.\n",
      "\n",
      "The database has to maintain information on which users are related to one another as friends,  the postings of each user, which users are allowed to see each posting, and a vast amount of other types of information needed for the correct operation of their Web site. For such Web sites, a large number of databases are needed to keep track of the constantly changing information required by the social media Web site. An example of a large commercial database is Amazon.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "It contains data for over 60 million active users, and millions of books, CDs, videos, DVDs, games, electronics, apparel, and other items. The database occupies over 42 terabytes (a terabyte is 10 12 bytes worth of storage) and is stored on hundreds of computers (called servers). Millions of visitors access Amazon.com each day and use the database to make purchases.\n",
      "\n",
      "The database is continually updated as new books and other items are added to the inventory, and stock quantities are updated as purchases are transacted. A database may be generated and maintained manually or it may be computer- ized. For example, a library card catalog is a database that may be created and maintained manually. A computerized database may be created and maintained either by a group of application programs written specifically for that task or by a 6 Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users database management system. Of course, we are only concerned with computer- ized databases in this text.\n",
      "\n",
      "A database management system (DBMS)  is a computerized system that enables users to create and maintain a database. The DBMS is a general-purpose software system  that facilitates the processes of defining, constructing, manipulating,  and sharing  databases among various users and applications. Defining  a database involves specifying the data types, structures, and constraints of the data to be stored in the database. The database definition or descriptive information is also stored by the DBMS in the form of a database catalog or dictionary; it is called meta-data .\n",
      "\n",
      "Constructing  the database is the process of storing the data on some storage medium that is controlled by the DBMS. Manipulating  a database includes functions such as querying the database to retrieve specific data, updating the data-base to reflect changes in the miniworld, and generating reports from the data. Sharing  a database allows multiple users and programs to access the database simultaneously. An application program  accesses the database by sending queries or requests for data to the DBMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "A query 2 typically causes some data to be retrieved; a transaction may cause some data to be read and some data to be written into the database. Other important functions provided by the DBMS include protecting  the database and maintaining  it over a long period of time. Protection  includes system protec- tion against hardware or software malfunction (or crashes) and security protection against unauthorized or malicious access.\n",
      "\n",
      "A typical large database may have a life cycle of many years, so the DBMS must be able to maintain  the database system by allowing the system to evolve as requirements change over time. It is not absolutely necessary to use general-purpose DBMS software to implement a computerized database. It is possible to write a customized set of programs to cre-ate and maintain the database, in effect creating a special-purpose  DBMS software for a specific application, such as airlines reservations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In either case—whether we use a general-purpose DBMS or not—a considerable amount of complex software is deployed. In fact, most DBMSs are very complex software systems. To complete our initial definitions, we will call the database and DBMS software together a database system . Figure 1.1 illustrates some of the concepts we have discussed so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.2 An Example   Let us consider a simple example that most readers may be familiar with: a UNIVERSITY  database for maintaining information concerning students, courses, and grades in a university environment. Figure 1.2 shows the database structure and a few sample data records. The database is organized as five files, each of which 2The term query , originally meaning a question or an inquiry, is sometimes loosely used for all types of interactions with databases, including modifying the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.2 An Example  7 stores data records  of the same type.3 The STUDENT  file stores data on each stu- dent, the COURSE  file stores data on each course, the SECTION  file stores data on each section of a course, the GRADE_REPORT  file stores the grades that students receive in the various sections they have completed, and the PREREQUISITE  file stores the prerequisites of each course.\n",
      "\n",
      "To define  this database, we must specify the structure of the records of each file by specifying the different types of data elements  to be stored in each record.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Figure 1.2, each STUDENT  record includes data to represent the student’s Name , Student_number , Class  (such as freshman or ‘1’, sophomore or ‘2’, and so forth), and Major (such as mathematics or ‘MATH’ and computer science or ‘CS’); each COURSE  record includes data to represent the Course_name, Course_number , Credit_hours , and Department  (the department that offers the course), and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must also specify a data type  for each data element within a record. For example, we can specify that Name  of STUDENT  is a string of alphabetic characters, Student_number  of STUDENT  is an integer, and Grade of GRADE_REPORT  is a 3We use the term file informally here. At a conceptual level, a file is a collection  of records that may or may not be ordered. STUDENT\n",

      "1.3.2  Insulation between Programs and Data, and Data Abstraction In traditional file processing, the structure of data files is embedded in the applica- tion programs, so any changes to the structure of a file may require changing all programs  that access that file. By contrast, DBMS access programs do not require such changes in most cases. The structure of data files is stored in the DBMS cata- log separately from the access programs. We call this property program-data independence .\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, a file access program may be written in such a way that it can access only STUDENT  records of the structure shown in Figure 1.4. If we want to add another piece of data to each STUDENT  record, say the Birth_date , such a program will no longer work and must be changed. By contrast, in a DBMS environment, we only need to change the description  of STUDENT  records in the catalog (Figure 1.3) to reflect the inclusion of the new data item Birth_date ; no programs are changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next time a DBMS program refers to the catalog, the new structure of STUDENT  records will be accessed and used. In some types of database systems, such as object-oriented and object-relational systems (see Chapter 12), users can define operations on data as part of the database definitions. An operation  (also called a function  or method ) is specified in two parts. The interface  (or signature ) of an operation includes the operation name and the data types of its arguments (or parameters).\n",
      "\n",
      "The implementation  (or method ) of the operation is specified separately and can be changed without affecting the inter-face. User application programs can operate on the data by invoking these opera-tions through their names and arguments, regardless of how the operations are implemented. This may be termed program-operation independence . The characteristic that allows program-data independence and program-operation independence is called data abstraction . A DBMS provides users with a conceptual representation  of data that does not include many of the details of how the data is stored or how the operations are implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Informally, a data model  is a type of data abstraction that is used to provide this conceptual representation. The data model uses logical concepts, such as objects, their properties, and their interrela-tionships, that may be easier for most users to understand than computer storage concepts. Hence, the data model hides  storage and implementation details that are not of interest to most database users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the example in Figures 1.2 and 1.3, the internal implementation of the STUDENT file may be defined by its record length—the number of characters (bytes) in each record—and each data item may be specified by its starting byte within a record and its length in bytes. The STUDENT  record would thus be repre- sented as shown in Figure 1.4.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a typical database user is not concerned with the location of each data item within a record or its length; rather, the user is concerned that when a reference is made to Name  of STUDENT , the correct value is returned. A conceptual representation of the STUDENT  records is shown in Figure 1.2. Many other details of file storage organization—such as the access paths specified on a  1.3 Characteristics of the Database Approach  13 file—can be hidden from database users by the DBMS; we discuss storage details in Chapters 16 and 17.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the database approach, the detailed structure and organization of each file are stored in the catalog. Database users and application programs refer to the concep-tual representation of the files, and the DBMS extracts the details of file storage from the catalog when these are needed by the DBMS file access modules. Many data models can be used to provide this data abstraction to database users. A major part of this text is devoted to presenting various data models and the concepts they use to abstract the representation of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "In object-oriented and object-relational databases, the abstraction process includes not only the data structure but also the operations on the data. These operations provide an abstraction of miniworld activities commonly understood by the users. For example, an operation CALCULATE_GPA  can be applied to a STUDENT  object to calculate the grade point average. Such operations can be invoked by the user queries or application programs without having to know the details of how the operations are implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.3.3 Support of Multiple Views of the Data A database typically has many types of users, each of whom may require a different perspective or view  of the database. A view may be a subset of the database or it may contain virtual data  that is derived from the database files but is not explicitly stored. Some users may not need to be aware of whether the data they refer to is stored or derived. A multiuser DBMS whose users have a variety of distinct applications must provide facilities for defining multiple views.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, one user of the database of Figure 1.2 may be interested only in accessing and printing the transcript of each student; the view for this user is shown in Figure 1.5(a). A second user, who is inter- ested only in checking that students have taken all the prerequisites of each course for which the student registers, may require the view shown in Figure 1.5(b).\n",
      "\n",
      "1.3.4 Sharing of Data and Multiuser Transaction Processing A multiuser DBMS, as its name implies, must allow multiple users to access the database at the same time. This is essential if data for multiple applications is to be integrated and maintained in a single database. The DBMS must include  concurrency control  software to ensure that several users trying to update the same data\n",

For exam- ple, when several reservation agents try to assign a seat on an airline flight, the DBMS should ensure that each seat can be accessed by only one agent at a time for assignment to a passenger. These types of applications are generally called online transaction processing (OLTP)  applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fundamental role of multiuser DBMS software is to ensure that concurrent transactions operate correctly and efficiently. The concept of a transaction  has become central to many database applications. A transaction is an executing program  or process  that includes one or more database accesses, such as reading or updating of database records. Each transaction is sup-posed to execute a logically correct database access if executed in its entirety with-out interference from other transactions. The DBMS must enforce several transaction properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "The isolation  property ensures that each transaction appears to execute in isolation from other transactions, even though hundreds of transactions may be executing concurrently. The atomicity  property ensures that either all the database operations in a transaction are executed or none are. We dis- cuss transactions in detail in Part 9. The preceding characteristics are important in distinguishing a DBMS from tradi- tional file-processing software. In Section 1.6 we discuss additional features that characterize a DBMS.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.4 Actors on the Scene   For a small personal database, such as the list of addresses discussed in Section 1.1, one person typically defines, constructs, and manipulates the database, and there is no sharing. However, in large organizations, many people are involved in the design, use, and maintenance of a large database with hundreds or thousands of users. In this section we identify the people whose jobs involve the day-to-day use of a large database; we call them the actors on the scene .\n",
      "\n",
      "In Section 1.5 we consider people who may be called workers behind the scene —those who work to maintain the database system environment but who are not actively interested in the data- base contents as part of their daily job.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.4.1 Database Administrators In any organization where many people use the same resources, there is a need for a chief administrator to oversee and manage these resources. In a database environ-ment, the primary resource is the database itself, and the secondary resource is the DBMS and related software. Administering these resources is the responsibility of the database administrator (DBA) . The DBA is responsible for authorizing access to the database, coordinating and monitoring its use, and acquiring software and hardware resources as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DBA is accountable for problems such as secu-rity breaches and poor system response time. In large organizations, the DBA is assisted by a staff that carries out these functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.4.2 Database Designers Database designers  are responsible for identifying the data to be stored in the data- base and for choosing appropriate structures to represent and store this data. These tasks are mostly undertaken before the database is actually implemented and popu-lated with data. It is the responsibility of database designers to communicate with all prospective database users in order to understand their requirements and to cre-ate a design that meets these requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "In many cases, the designers are on the staff of the DBA and may be assigned other staff responsibilities after the database design is completed. Database designers typically interact with each potential group of users and develop views  of the database that meet the data and processing requirements of these groups. Each view is then analyzed and integrated  with the views of other user groups. The final database design must be capable of supporting the requirements of all user groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.4.3 End Users End users  are the people whose jobs require access to the database for querying, updating, and generating reports; the database primarily exists for their use. There are several categories of end users: ■ Casual end users  occasionally access the database, but they may need differ- ent information each time. They use a sophisticated database query interface 16 Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users to specify their requests and are typically middle- or high-level managers or other occasional browsers.\n",
      "\n",
      "■ Naive  or parametric end users  make up a sizable portion of database end users. Their main job function revolves around constantly querying and updating the database, using standard types of queries and updates—called canned transactions —that have been carefully programmed and tested. Many of these tasks are now available as mobile apps  for use with mobile devices. The tasks that such users perform are varied. A few examples are: /box4 Bank customers and tellers check account balances and post withdrawals and deposits.\n",
      "\n",
      "/box4 Reservation agents or customers for airlines, hotels, and car rental com- panies check availability for a given request and make reservations. /box4 Employees at receiving stations for shipping companies enter package identifications via bar codes and descriptive information through buttons to update a central database of received and in-transit packages. /box4 Social media users post and read items on social media Web sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "■ Sophisticated end users  include engineers, scientists, business analysts, and others who thoroughly familiarize themselves with the facilities of the DBMS in order to implement their own applications to meet their complex require- ments. ■ Standalone users  maintain personal databases by using ready-made pro- gram packages that provide easy-to-use menu-based or graphics-based interfaces. An example is the user of a financial software package that stores a variety of personal financial data. A typical DBMS provides multiple facilities to access a database.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naive end users need to learn very little about the facilities provided by the DBMS; they simply have to understand the user interfaces of the mobile apps or standard transactions designed and implemented for their use. Casual users learn only a few facilities that they may use repeatedly. Sophisticated users try to learn most of the DBMS facilities in order to achieve their complex requirements. Standalone users typically become very proficient in using a specific software package.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.4.4  System Analysts and Application Programmers (Software Engineers) System analysts  determine the requirements of end users, especially naive and parametric end users, and develop specifications for standard canned transactions that meet these requirements. Application programmers  implement these specifi- cations as programs; then they test, debug, document, and maintain these canned transactions.\n",

      "1.5 Workers behind the Scene   In addition to those who design, use, and administer a database, others are associ- ated with the design, development, and operation of the DBMS software and system environment. These persons are typically not interested in the database content itself. We call them the workers behind the scene , and they include the following categories: ■ DBMS system designers and implementers  design and implement the DBMS modules and interfaces as a software package.\n",
      "\n",
      "A DBMS is a very complex software system that consists of many components, or modules , including modules for implementing the catalog, query language process-ing, interface processing, accessing and buffering data, controlling concur-rency, and handling data recovery and security. The DBMS must interface with other system software, such as the operating system and compilers for various programming languages. ■ Tool developers  design and implement tools —the software packages that facilitate database modeling and design, database system design, and improved performance. Tools are optional packages that are often pur-chased separately.\n",
      "\n",
      "They include packages for database design, performance monitoring, natural language or graphical interfaces, prototyping, simula-tion, and test data generation. In many cases, independent software vendors develop and market these tools. ■ Operators and maintenance personnel  (system administration personnel) are responsible for the actual running and maintenance of the hardware and software environment for the database system. Although these categories of workers behind the scene are instrumental in making the database system available to end users, they typically do not use the database contents for their own purposes.\n",

      "1.6 Advantages of Using the DB MS Approach In this section we discuss some additional advantages of using a DBMS and the capabilities that a good DBMS should possess. These capabilities are in addition to the four main characteristics discussed in Section 1.3. The DBA must utilize these capabilities to accomplish a variety of objectives related to the design, administra-tion, and use of a large multiuser database.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.6.1 Controlling Redundancy In traditional software development utilizing file processing, every user group maintains its own files for handling its data-processing applications. For example, consider the UNIVERSITY  database example of Section 1.2; here, two groups of users might be the course registration personnel and the accounting office. In the traditional approach, each group independently keeps files on students.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 18 Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users accounting office keeps data on registration and related billing information, whereas the registration office keeps track of student courses and grades. Other groups may further duplicate some or all of the same data in their own files. This redundancy  in storing the same data multiple times leads to several problems. First, there is the need to perform a single logical update—such as entering data on a new student—multiple times: once for each file where student data is recorded. This leads to duplication of effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, storage space is wasted  when the same data is stored repeatedly, and this problem may be serious for large databases. Third, files that represent the same data may become inconsistent. This may happen because an update is applied to some of the files but not to others. Even if an update—such as adding a new student—is applied to all the appropriate files, the data concerning the student may still be inconsistent  because the updates are applied independently by each user group.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, one user group may enter a stu-dent’s birth date erroneously as ‘JAN-19-1988’, whereas the other user groups may enter the correct value of ‘JAN-29-1988’. In the database approach, the views of different user groups are integrated during database design. Ideally, we should have a database design that stores each logical data item—such as a student’s name or birth date—in only one place  in the data- base.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is known as data normalization , and it ensures consistency and saves storage space (data normalization is described in Part 6 of the text). However, in practice, it is sometimes necessary to use controlled redundancy  to improve the performance of queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we may store Student_name  and Course_number  redundantly in a GRADE_REPORT  file (Figure 1.6(a)) because whenever we retrieve a GRADE_REPORT  record, we want to retrieve the student name and course number along with the grade, student number, and section identi- fier. By placing all the data together, we do not have to search multiple files to col- lect this data. This is known as denormalization . In such cases, the DBMS should GRADE_REPORT\n",

      "This may be done by automatically checking that the Student_name–Student_number  values in any GRADE_REPORT  record in Fig- ure 1.6(a) match one of the Name–Student_number  values of a STUDENT  record (Fig- ure 1.2). Similarly, the Section_identifier–Course_number  values in GRADE_REPORT can be checked against SECTION  records.\n",

Can you tell which part is inconsistent?\n",
      "\n",
      "1.6.2 Restricting Unauthorized Access When multiple users share a large database, it is likely that most users will not be authorized to access all information in the database. For example, financial data such as salaries and bonuses is often considered confidential, and only autho-rized persons are allowed to access such data. In addition, some users may only be permitted to retrieve data, whereas others are allowed to retrieve and update. Hence, the type of access operation—retrieval or update—must also be con-trolled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typically, users or user groups are given account numbers protected by passwords, which they can use to gain access to the database. A DBMS should provide a security and authorization subsystem , which the DBA uses to create accounts and to specify account restrictions. Then, the DBMS should enforce these restrictions automatically. Notice that we can apply similar controls to the DBMS software. For example, only the DBA’s staff may be allowed to use certain privileged software , such as the software for creating new accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, parametric users may be allowed to access the database only through the pre-defined apps or canned transactions developed for their use. We discuss data-base security and authorization in Chapter 30.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.6.3 Providing Persistent Storage for Program Objects Databases can be used to provide persistent storage  for program objects and data structures. This is one of the main reasons for object-oriented database systems (see Chapter 12). Programming languages typically have complex data structures, such as structs or class definitions in C++ or Java. The values of program variables or objects are discarded once a program terminates, unless the programmer explic-itly stores them in permanent files, which often involves converting these complex structures into a format suitable for file storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the need arises to read this data once more, the programmer must convert from the file format to the program variable or object structure. Object-oriented database systems are compatible with programming languages such as C++ and Java, and the DBMS software auto-matically performs any necessary conversions. Hence, a complex object in C++ can be stored permanently in an object-oriented DBMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such an object is said to be persistent , since it survives the termination of program execution and can later be directly retrieved by another program.20 Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users The persistent storage of program objects and data structures is an important func- tion of database systems. Traditional database systems often suffered from the so-called impedance mismatch problem , since the data structures provided by the DBMS were incompatible with the programming language’s data structures. Object-oriented database systems typically offer data structure compatibility  with one or more object-oriented programming languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.6.4  Providing Storage Structures and Search Techniques for Efficient Query Processing Database systems must provide capabilities for efficiently executing queries and updates. Because the database is typically stored on disk, the DBMS must provide specialized data structures and search techniques to speed up disk search for the desired records. Auxiliary files called indexes  are often used for this purpose. Indexes are typically based on tree data structures or hash data structures that are suitably modified for disk search.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to process the database records needed by a particular query, those records must be copied from disk to main memory. Therefore, the DBMS often has a buffering  or caching  module that maintains parts of the database in main memory buffers. In general, the operating system is respon-sible for disk-to-memory buffering. However, because data buffering is crucial to the DBMS performance, most DBMSs do their own data buffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "The query processing and optimization  module of the DBMS is responsible for choosing an efficient query execution plan for each query based on the existing storage structures. The choice of which indexes to create and maintain is part of physical database design and tuning,  which is one of the responsibilities of the DBA staff. We discuss query processing and optimization in Part 8 of the text.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.6.5 Providing Backup and Recovery A DBMS must provide facilities for recovering from hardware or software failures. The backup and recovery subsystem  of the DBMS is responsible for recovery. For example, if the computer system fails in the middle of a complex update transac-tion, the recovery subsystem is responsible for making sure that the database is restored to the state it was in before the transaction started executing. Disk backup is also necessary in case of a catastrophic disk failure. We discuss recovery and backup in Chapter 22.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.6.6 Providing Multiple User Interfaces Because many types of users with varying levels of technical knowledge use a data-base, a DBMS should provide a variety of user interfaces. These include apps for mobile users, query languages for casual users, programming language interfaces for application programmers, forms and command codes for parametric users, and menu-driven interfaces and natural language interfaces for standalone users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both forms-style interfaces and menu-driven interfaces are commonly known as  1.6 Advantages of Using the DBMS Approach  21 graphical user interfaces (GUIs) . Many specialized languages and environments exist for specifying GUIs. Capabilities for providing Web GUI interfaces to a database—or Web-enabling a database—are also quite common.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.6.7 Representing Complex Relationships among Data A database may include numerous varieties of data that are interrelated in many ways. Consider the example shown in Figure 1.2. The record for ‘Brown’ in the STUDENT  file is related to four records in the GRADE_REPORT  file. Similarly, each section record is related to one course record and to a number of GRADE_REPORT  records—one for each student who completed that section.\n",
      "\n",
      "A DBMS must have the capability to represent a variety of complex relationships among the data, to define new relationships as they arise, and to retrieve and update related data easily and efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.6.8 Enforcing Integrity Constraints Most database applications have certain integrity constraints  that must hold for the data. A DBMS should provide capabilities for defining and enforcing these constraints. The simplest type of integrity constraint involves specifying a data type for each data item. For example, in Figure 1.3, we specified that the value of the Class  data item within each STUDENT  record must be a one-digit integer and that the value of Name  must be a string of no more than 30 alphabetic characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "To restrict the value of Class  between 1 and 5 would be an additional constraint that is not shown in the current catalog. A more complex type of constraint that frequently occurs involves specifying that a record in one file must be related to records in other files. For example, in Figure 1.2, we can specify that every section record must be related to a course record . This is known as a referential integrity constraint. Another type of constraint specifies uniqueness on data item values, such as every course record must have a unique value for Course_number .\n",
      "\n",
      "This is known as a key or uniqueness  constraint. These constraints are derived from the meaning or semantics  of the data and of the miniworld it represents. It is the responsibility of the database designers to identify integrity constraints during database design. Some constraints can be specified to the DBMS and automatically enforced. Other constraints may have to be checked by update programs or at the time of data entry. For typical large applications, it is customary to call such con-straints business rules .\n",
      "\n",
      "A data item may be entered erroneously and still satisfy the specified integrity con- straints. For example, if a student receives a grade of ‘A’ but a grade of ‘C’ is entered in the database, the DBMS cannot  discover this error automatically because ‘C’ is a valid value for the Grade  data type. Such data entry errors can only be discovered manually (when the student receives the grade and complains) and corrected later by updating the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, a grade of ‘Z’ would be rejected automatically by the DBMS because ‘Z’ is not a valid value for the Grade  data type. When we dis- cuss each data model in subsequent chapters, we will introduce rules that pertain to 22 Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users that model implicitly. For example, in the Entity-Relationship model in Chapter 3, a relationship must involve at least two entities. Rules that pertain to a specific data model are called inherent rules  of the data model.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.6.9  Permitting Inferencing and Actions Using Rules and Triggers Some database systems provide capabilities for defining deduction rules  for infer- encing  new information from the stored database facts. Such systems are called deductive database systems . For example, there may be complex rules in the mini- world application for determining when a student is on probation. These can be specified declaratively  as rules , which when compiled and maintained by the DBMS can determine all students on probation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a traditional DBMS, an explicit proce- dural program code  would have to be written to support such applications. But if the miniworld rules change, it is generally more convenient to change the declared deduction rules than to recode procedural programs. In today’s relational database systems, it is possible to associate triggers  with tables. A trigger is a form of a rule activated by updates to the table, which results in performing some additional oper-ations to some other tables, sending messages, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "More involved proce-dures to enforce rules are popularly called stored procedures ; they become a part of the overall database definition and are invoked appropriately when certain condi- tions are met. More powerful functionality is provided by active database systems , which provide active rules that can automatically initiate actions when certain events and conditions occur (see Chapter 26 for introductions to active databases in Section 26.1 and deductive databases in Section 26.5).\n",
      "\n",
      "1.6.10  Additional Implications of Using the Database Approach This section discusses a few additional implications of using the database approach that can benefit most organizations. Potential for Enforcing Standards. The database approach permits the DBA to define and enforce standards among database users in a large organization. This facil- itates communication and cooperation among various departments, projects, and users within the organization. Standards can be defined for names and formats of data elements, display formats, report structures, terminology, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DBA can enforce standards in a centralized database environment more easily than in an environment where each user group has control of its own data files and software. Reduced Application Development Time. A prime selling feature of the data- base approach is that developing a new application—such as the retrieval of certain data from the database for printing a new report—takes very little time. Designing and implementing a large multiuser database from scratch may take more time than writing a single specialized file application.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, once a database is up and running, substantially less time is generally required to create new applications  1.7 A Brief History of Database Applications  23 using DBMS facilities. Development time using a DBMS is estimated to be one- sixth to one-fourth of that for a file system. Flexibility. It may be necessary to change the structure of a database as require- ments change. For example, a new user group may emerge that needs information not currently in the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response, it may be necessary to add a file to the database or to extend the data elements in an existing file. Modern DBMSs allow certain types of evolutionary changes to the structure of the database without affect-ing the stored data and the existing application programs. Availability of Up-to-Date Information. A DBMS makes the database available to all users. As soon as one user’s update is applied to the database, all other users can immediately see this update.\n",
      "\n",
      "This availability of up-to-date information is essential for many transaction-processing applications, such as reservation systems or banking databases, and it is made possible by the concurrency control and recov-ery subsystems of a DBMS. Economies of Scale. The DBMS approach permits consolidation of data and applications, thus reducing the amount of wasteful overlap between activities of data-processing personnel in different projects or departments as well as redundan-cies among applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "This enables the whole organization to invest in more powerful processors, storage devices, or networking gear, rather than having each department purchase its own (lower performance) equipment. This reduces overall costs of operation and management.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.7 A Brief History of Database Applications   We now give a brief historical overview of the applications that use DBMSs and how these applications provided the impetus for new types of database systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.7.1  Early Database Applications Using Hierarchical and Network Systems Many early database applications maintained records in large organizations such as corporations, universities, hospitals, and banks. In many of these applications, there were large numbers of records of similar structure. For example, in a univer-sity application, similar information would be kept for each student, each course, each grade record, and so on. There were also many types of records and many interrelationships among them.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the main problems with early database systems was the intermixing of con- ceptual relationships with the physical storage and placement of records on disk. Hence, these systems did not provide sufficient data abstraction  and program-data independence  capabilities. For example, the grade records of a particular student could be physically stored next to the student record. Although this provided very 24 Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users efficient access for the original queries and transactions that the database was designed to handle, it did not provide enough flexibility to access records efficiently when new queries and transactions were identified.\n",
      "\n",
      "In particular, new queries that required a different storage organization for efficient processing were quite difficult to implement efficiently. It was also laborious to reorganize the database when changes were made to the application’s requirements. Another shortcoming of early systems was that they provided only programming language interfaces. This made it time-consuming and expensive to implement new queries and transactions, since new programs had to be written, tested, and debugged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of these database systems were implemented on large and expensive mainframe computers starting in the mid-1960s and continuing through the 1970s and 1980s. The main types of early systems were based on three main paradigms: hierarchical systems, network model–based systems, and inverted file systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.7.2  Providing Data Abstraction and Application Flexibility with Relational Databases Relational databases were originally proposed to separate the physical storage of data from its conceptual representation and to provide a mathematical foundation for data representation and querying. The relational data model also introduced high-level query languages that provided an alternative to programming language interfaces, making it much faster to write new queries. Relational representation of data somewhat resembles the example we presented in Figure 1.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relational sys-tems were initially targeted to the same applications as earlier systems, and pro- vided flexibility to develop new queries quickly and to reorganize the database as requirements changed. Hence, data abstraction  and program-data independence were much improved when compared to earlier systems. Early experimental relational systems developed in the late 1970s and the com- mercial relational database management systems (RDBMS) introduced in the early 1980s were quite slow, since they did not use physical storage pointers or record placement to access related data records.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the development of new storage and indexing techniques and better query processing and optimization, their performance improved. Eventually, relational databases became the domi-nant type of database system for traditional database applications. Relational data- bases now exist on almost all types of computers, from small personal computers to large servers.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.7.3  Object-Oriented Applications and the Need for More Complex Databases The emergence of object-oriented programming languages in the 1980s and the need to store and share complex, structured objects led to the development of object-oriented databases (OODBs). Initially, OODBs were considered a competitor  1.7 A Brief History of Database Applications  25 to relational databases, since they provided more general data structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also incorporated many of the useful object-oriented paradigms, such as abstract data types, encapsulation of operations, inheritance, and object identity. However, the complexity of the model and the lack of an early standard contributed to their lim-ited use. They are now mainly used in specialized applications, such as engineering design, multimedia publishing, and manufacturing systems. Despite expectations that they will make a big impact, their overall penetration into the database prod-ucts market remains low.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, many object-oriented concepts were incor-porated into the newer versions of relational DBMSs, leading to object-relational database management systems, known as ORDBMSs.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.7.4  Interchanging Data on the Web for E-Commerce Using XML The World Wide Web provides a large network of interconnected computers. Users can create static Web pages using a Web publishing language, such as Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML), and store these documents on Web servers where other users (clients) can access them and view them through Web browsers. Docu-ments can be linked through hyperlinks , which are pointers to other documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting in the 1990s, electronic commerce (e-commerce) emerged as a major application on the Web. Much of the critical information on e-commerce Web pages is dynamically extracted data from DBMSs, such as flight information, prod-uct prices, and product availability. A variety of techniques were developed to allow the interchange of dynamically extracted data on the Web for display on Web pages. The eXtended Markup Language (XML) is one standard for interchanging data among various types of databases and Web pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "XML combines concepts from the models used in document systems with database modeling concepts. Chapter 13 is devoted to an overview of XML.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.7.5  Extending Database Capabilities for New Applications The success of database systems in traditional applications encouraged devel- opers of other types of applications to attempt to use them. Such applications traditionally used their own specialized software and file and data structures. Database systems now offer extensions to better support the specialized require-ments for some of these applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following are some examples of these applications: ■ Scientific  applications that store large amounts of data resulting from scien- tific experiments in areas such as high-energy physics, the mapping of the human genome, and the discovery of protein structures ■ Storage and retrieval of images , including scanned news or personal photo- graphs, satellite photographic images, and images from medical procedures such as x-rays and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) tests26 Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users ■ Storage and retrieval of videos , such as movies, and video clips  from news or personal digital cameras ■ Data mining  applications that analyze large amounts of data to search for the occurrences of specific patterns or relationships, and for identifying unusual patterns in areas such as credit card fraud detection ■ Spatial  applications that store and analyze spatial locations of data, such as weather information, maps used in geographical information systems, and automobile navigational systems ■ Time series  applications that store information such as economic data at regular points in time, such as daily sales and monthly gross national product figures It was quickly apparent that basic relational systems were not very suitable for many of these applications, usually for one or more of the following reasons: ■ More complex data structures were needed for modeling the application than the simple relational representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "■ New data types were needed in addition to the basic numeric and character string types. ■ New operations and query language constructs were necessary to manipu- late the new data types. ■ New storage and indexing structures were needed for efficient searching on the new data types. This led DBMS developers to add functionality to their systems. Some functionality was general purpose, such as incorporating concepts from object-oriented data-bases into relational systems. Other functionality was special purpose, in the form of optional modules that could be used for specific applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, users could buy a time series module to use with their relational DBMS for their time series application.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.7.6  Emergence of Big Data Storage Systems and NOSQL Databases In the first decade of the twenty-first century, the proliferation of applications and platforms such as social media Web sites, large e-commerce companies, Web search indexes, and cloud storage/backup led to a surge in the amount of data stored on large databases and massive servers.\n",
      "\n",
      "New types of database systems were necessary to manage these huge databases—systems that would provide fast search and retrieval as well as reliable and safe storage of nontraditional types of data, such as social media posts and tweets. Some of the requirements of these new systems were not compatible with SQL relational DBMSs (SQL is the standard data model and language for relational databases).\n",
      "\n",
      "The term NOSQL  is generally interpreted as Not Only SQL, meaning that in systems than manage large amounts of data, some of the data is stored using SQL systems, whereas other data would be stored using NOSQL, depending on the application requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.8 When Not to Use a DBMS   In spite of the advantages of using a DBMS, there are a few situations in which a DBMS may involve unnecessary overhead costs that would not be incurred in traditional file processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overhead costs of using a DBMS are due to the following: ■ High initial investment in hardware, software, and training ■ The generality that a DBMS provides for defining and processing data ■ Overhead for providing security, concurrency control, recovery, and integ- rity functions   Therefore, it may be more desirable to develop customized database applications under the following circumstances: ■ Simple, well-defined database applications that are not expected to change at all ■ Stringent, real-time requirements for some application programs that may not be met because of DBMS overhead ■ Embedded systems with limited storage capacity, where a general-purpose DBMS would not fit ■ No multiple-user access to data Certain industries and applications have elected not to use general-purpose   DBMSs.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, many computer-aided design (CAD) tools used by mechanical and civil engineers have proprietary file and data management software that is geared for the internal manipulations of drawings and 3D objects. Similarly, communication and switching systems designed by companies like AT&T were early manifestations of database software that was made to run very fast with hierarchically organized data for quick access and routing of calls. GIS implementations often implement their own data organization schemes for efficiently implementing functions related to processing maps, physical contours, lines, polygons, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.9 Summary   In this chapter we defined a database as a collection of related data, where data means recorded facts. A typical database represents some aspect of the real world and is used for specific purposes by one or more groups of users. A DBMS is a generalized software package for implementing and maintaining a computerized database. The database and software together form a database system. We identified several characteristics that distinguish the database approach from traditional file-processing applications, and we discussed the main categories of database users, or the actors on the scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "We noted that in addition to database users, there are several categories of support personnel, or workers behind the scene, in a data- base environment. We presented a list of capabilities that should be provided by the DBMS software to the DBA, database designers, and end users to help them design, administer, and use a database. Then we gave a brief historical perspective on the evolution of database applications. We pointed out the recent rapid growth of the amounts and types of data that must be stored in databases, and we discussed the emergence of new systems for handling “big data” applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we discussed the overhead costs of using a DBMS and discussed some situations in which it may not be advantageous to use one.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.One fundamental characteristic of the database approach is that it provides some level of data abstraction. Data abstraction  generally refers to the suppression of details of data organization and storage, and the highlighting of the essential fea-tures for an improved understanding of data. One of the main characteristics of the database approach is to support data abstraction so that different users can perceive data at their preferred level of detail. A data model —a collection of concepts that can be used to describe the structure of a database—provides the necessary means to achieve this abstraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 By structure of a database  we mean the data types, rela- tionships, and constraints that apply to the data. Most data models also include a set of basic operations  for specifying retrievals and updates on the database. In addition to the basic operations provided by the data model, it is becoming more common to include concepts in the data model to specify the dynamic aspect  or behavior  of a database application. This allows the database designer to specify a set of valid user-defined operations that are allowed on the database objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "3 An example of a user-defined operation could be COMPUTE_GPA , which can be applied to a STUDENT  object. On the other hand, generic operations to insert, delete, modify, or retrieve any kind of object are often included in the basic data model operations . Concepts to specify behavior are fundamental to object-oriented data models (see Chapter 12) but are also being incorporated in more traditional data models. For example, object-relational models (see Chapter 12) extend the basic relational model to include such concepts, among others.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the basic relational data model, there is a provision to attach behavior to the relations in the form of persis-tent stored modules, popularly known as stored procedures (see Chapter 10). 2Sometimes the word model  is used to denote a specific database description, or schema—for example, the marketing data model . We will not use this interpretation. 3The inclusion of concepts to describe behavior reflects a trend whereby database design and software design activities are increasingly being combined into a single activity. Traditionally, specifying behavior is associated with software design.\n",

      "2.1.1 Categories of Data Models Many data models have been proposed, which we can categorize according to the types of concepts they use to describe the database structure. High-level  or conceptual data models  provide concepts that are close to the way many users per- ceive data, whereas low-level  or physical data models  provide concepts that describe the details of how data is stored on the computer storage media, typically magnetic disks. Concepts provided by physical data models are generally meant for computer specialists, not for end users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between these two extremes is a class of representational (or implementation ) data models , 4 which provide concepts that may be easily understood by end users but that are not too far removed from the way data is orga-nized in computer storage. Representational data models hide many details of data storage on disk but can be implemented on a computer system directly. Conceptual data models use concepts such as entities, attributes, and relationships. An entity  represents a real-world object or concept, such as an employee or a project from the miniworld that is described in the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "An attribute  represents some property of interest that further describes an entity, such as the employee’s name or salary. A relationship  among two or more entities represents an association among the entities, for example, a works-on relationship between an employee and a project. Chapter 3 presents the entity–relationship model —a popular high-level conceptual data model. Chapter 4 describes additional abstractions used for advanced modeling, such as generalization, specialization, and categories (union types).\n",
      "\n",
      "Representational or implementation data models are the models used most fre- quently in traditional commercial DBMSs. These include the widely used relational data model , as well as the so-called legacy data models—the network  and hierarchical models —that have been widely used in the past. Part 3 of the text is devoted to the relational data model, and its constraints, operations, and languages. 5 The SQL standard for relational databases is described in Chapters 6 and 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "Repre-sentational data models represent data by using record structures and hence are sometimes called record-based data models . We can regard the object data model  as an example of a new family of higher-level implementation data models that are closer to conceptual data models. A standard for object databases called the ODMG object model has been proposed by the Object Data Management Group (ODMG). We describe the general characteristics of object databases and the object model proposed standard in Chapter 12.\n",
      "\n",
      "Object data models are also frequently utilized as high-level conceptual models, particu- larly in the software engineering domain. Physical data models describe how data is stored as files in the computer by repre- senting information such as record formats, record orderings, and access paths.

They are accessible from the book’s Web site.34 Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture access path  is a search structure that makes the search for particular database records efficient, such as indexing or hashing. We discuss physical storage tech-niques and access structures in Chapters 16 and 17. An index  is an example of an access path that allows direct access to data using an index term or a keyword.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is similar to the index at the end of this text, except that it may be organized in a lin-ear, hierarchical (tree-structured), or some other fashion. Another class of data models is known as self-describing data models . The data storage in systems based on these models combines the description of the data with the data values themselves. In traditional DBMSs, the description (schema) is sepa-rated from the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "These models include XML  (see Chapter 12) as well as many of the key-value stores  and NOSQL systems  (see Chapter 24) that were recently cre- ated for managing big data.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.1.2 Schemas, Instances, and Database State In a data model, it is important to distinguish between the description  of the database and the database itself . The description of a database is called the database schema , which is specified during database design and is not expected to change frequently.6 Most data models have certain conventions for displaying schemas as diagrams.7 A displayed schema is called a schema diagram .\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 2.1 shows a schema diagram for the database shown in Figure 1.2; the diagram dis- plays the structure of each record type but not the actual instances of records. 6Schema changes are usually needed as the requirements of the database applications change. Most database systems include operations for allowing schema changes. 7It is customary in database parlance to use schemas  as the plural for schema , even though schemata  is the proper plural form.\n",

      "2.1 Data Models, Schemas, and Instances  35 We call each object in the schema—such as STUDENT  or COURSE —a schema construct . A schema diagram displays only some aspects  of a schema, such as the names of record types and data items, and some types of constraints. Other aspects are not specified in the schema diagram; for example, Figure 2.1 shows neither the data type of each data item nor the relationships among the various files. Many types of constraints are not represented in schema diagrams.\n",
      "\n",
      "A constraint such as students majoring in computer science must take CS1310 before the end of their sophomore year  is quite difficult to represent diagrammatically. The actual data in a database may change quite frequently. For example, the data- base shown in Figure 1.2 changes every time we add a new student or enter a new grade. The data in the database at a particular moment in time is called a database state  or snapshot . It is also called the current  set of occurrences  or instances  in the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a given database state, each schema construct has its own current set of instances; for example, the STUDENT  construct will contain the set of indi- vidual student entities (records) as its instances. Many database states can be con- structed to correspond to a particular database schema. Every time we insert or delete a record or change the value of a data item in a record, we change one state of the database into another state. The distinction between database schema and database state is very important.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we define  a new database, we specify its database schema only to the DBMS. At this point, the corresponding database state is the empty state  with no data. We get the initial state  of the database when the database is first populated  or loaded  with the initial data. From then on, every time an update operation is applied to the database, we get another database state. At any point in time, the database has a current state .\n",
      "\n",
      "8 The DBMS is partly responsible for ensuring that every state of the database is a valid state —that is, a state that satisfies the structure and constraints specified in the schema. Hence, specify- ing a correct schema to the DBMS is extremely important and the schema must be designed with utmost care. The DBMS stores the descriptions of the schema constructs and constraints—also called the meta-data —in the DBMS catalog so that DBMS software can refer to the schema whenever it needs to.\n",
      "\n",
      "The schema is sometimes called the intension , and a database state is called an extension  of the schema. Although, as mentioned earlier, the schema is not supposed to change frequently, it is not uncommon that changes occasionally need to be applied to the schema as the application requirements change. For example, we may decide that another data item needs to be stored for each record in a file, such as adding the Date_of_birth to the STUDENT  schema in Figure 2.1. This is known as schema evolution .\n",
      "\n",
      "Most modern DBMSs include some operations for schema evolution that can be applied while the database is operational. 8The current state is also called the current snapshot  of the database. It has also been called a database instance , but we prefer to use the term instance  to refer to individual records.36 Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture\n",

      "2.2  Three-Schema Architecture   and Data Independence Three of the four important characteristics of the database approach, listed in Section 1.3, are (1) use of a catalog to store the database description (schema) so as to make it self-describing, (2) insulation of programs and data (program-data and program-operation independence), and (3) support of multiple user views. In this section we specify an architecture for database systems, called the  three-schema architecture , 9 that was proposed to help achieve and visualize these characteristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we discuss further the concept of data independence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2.1 The Three-Schema Architecture The goal of the three-schema architecture, illustrated in Figure 2.2, is to separate the user applications from the physical database. In this architecture, schemas can be defined at the following three levels:  1. The internal level  has an internal schema , which describes the physical storage structure of the database. The internal schema uses a physical data model and describes the complete details of data storage and access paths for the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "9This is also known as the ANSI/SPARC (American National Standards Institute/ Standards Planning And Requirements Committee) architecture, after the committee that proposed it (Tsichritzis & Klug, 1978).External View Conceptual Schema Internal Schema Stored DatabaseExternal View Internal LevelConceptual/InternalMappingConceptual LevelExternal/Conceptual MappingExternal LevelEnd Users . . .Figure 2.2 The three-schema architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2 Three-Schema Architecture and Data Independence  37 2. The conceptual level  has a conceptual schema , which describes the structure of the whole database for a community of users. The conceptual schema hides the details of physical storage structures and concentrates on describing enti-ties, data types, relationships, user operations, and constraints. Usually, a rep-resentational data model is used to describe the conceptual schema when a database system is implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "This implementation conceptual schema  is often based on a conceptual schema design  in a high-level data model. 3. The external  or view level  includes a number of external schemas  or user views . Each external schema describes the part of the database that a partic- ular user group is interested in and hides the rest of the database from that user group. As in the previous level, each external schema is typically imple-mented using a representational data model, possibly based on an external schema design in a high-level conceptual data model.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three-schema architecture is a convenient tool with which the user can visual- ize the schema levels in a database system. Most DBMSs do not separate the three levels completely and explicitly, but they support the three-schema architecture to some extent. Some older DBMSs may include physical-level details in the concep-tual schema. The three-level ANSI architecture has an important place in database technology development because it clearly separates the users’ external level, the database’s conceptual level, and the internal storage level for designing a database.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is very much applicable in the design of DBMSs, even today. In most DBMSs that support user views, external schemas are specified in the same data model that describes the conceptual-level information (for example, a relational DBMS like Oracle or SQLServer uses SQL for this). Notice that the three schemas are only descriptions  of data; the actual data is stored at the physical level only. In the three-schema architecture, each user group refers to its own external schema.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, the DBMS must transform a request specified on an external schema into a request against the conceptual schema, and then into a request on the internal schema for processing over the stored database. If the request is a database retrieval, the data extracted from the stored database must be reformatted to match the user’s external view. The processes of transforming requests and results between levels are called mappings . These mappings may be time-consuming, so some DBMSs—especially those that are meant to support small databases—do not support external views.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even in such systems, however, it is nec-essary to transform requests between the conceptual and internal levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2.2 Data Independence The three-schema architecture can be used to further explain the concept of data independence , which can be defined as the capacity to change the schema at one level of a database system without having to change the schema at the next higher level. We can define two types of data independence: 1. Logical data independence  is the capacity to change the conceptual schema without having to change external schemas or application programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "We 38 Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture may change the conceptual schema to expand the database (by adding a record type or data item), to change constraints, or to reduce the database (by removing a record type or data item). In the last case, external schemas that refer only to the remaining data should not be affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the external schema of Figure 1.5(a) should not be affected by changing the GRADE_REPORT  file (or record type) shown in Figure 1.2 into the one shown in Figure 1.6(a). Only the view definition and the mappings need to be changed in a DBMS that supports logical data independence. After the conceptual schema undergoes a logical reorganization, application pro-grams that reference the external schema constructs must work as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Changes to constraints can be applied to the conceptual schema without affecting the external schemas or application programs. 2. Physical data independence  is the capacity to change the internal schema without having to change the conceptual schema. Hence, the external sche-mas need not be changed as well. Changes to the internal schema may be needed because some physical files were reorganized—for example, by cre-ating additional access structures—to improve the performance of retrieval or update. If the same data as before remains in the database, we should not have to change the conceptual schema.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, providing an access path to improve retrieval speed of SECTION records (Figure 1.2) by semes-ter and year should not require a query such as list all sections offered in fall 2008  to be changed, although the query would be executed more efficiently by the DBMS by utilizing the new access path.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, physical data independence exists in most databases and file environ- ments where physical details, such as the exact location of data on disk, and hard-ware details of storage encoding, placement, compression, splitting, merging of records, and so on are hidden from the user. Applications remain unaware of these details. On the other hand, logical data independence is harder to achieve because it allows structural and constraint changes without affecting application programs—a much stricter requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever we have a multiple-level DBMS, its catalog must be expanded to include information on how to map requests and data among the various levels. The DBMS uses additional software to accomplish these mappings by referring to the mapping information in the catalog. Data independence occurs because when the schema is changed at some level, the schema at the next higher level remains unchanged; only the mapping  between the two levels is changed. Hence, application programs refer- ring to the higher-level schema need not be changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.3 Database Languages and Interfaces   In Section 1.4 we discussed the variety of users supported by a DBMS. The DBMS must provide appropriate languages and interfaces for each category of users. In this section we discuss the types of languages and interfaces provided by a DBMS and the user categories targeted by each interface. 2.3 Database Languages and Interfaces  39\n",
      "\n",
      "2.3.1 DBMS Languages Once the design of a database is completed and a DBMS is chosen to implement the database, the first step is to specify conceptual and internal schemas for the data-base and any mappings between the two. In many DBMSs where no strict separa-tion of levels is maintained, one language, called the data definition language (DDL ), is used by the DBA and by database designers to define both schemas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DBMS will have a DDL compiler whose function is to process DDL statements in order to identify descriptions of the schema constructs and to store the schema description in the DBMS catalog. In DBMSs where a clear separation is maintained between the conceptual and internal levels, the DDL is used to specify the conceptual schema only. Another language, the storage definition language  (SDL ), is used to specify the internal schema. The mappings between the two schemas may be specified in either one of these languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "In most relational DBMSs today, there is no specific language  that performs the role of SDL. Instead, the internal schema is specified by a combination of functions, parameters, and specifications related to storage of files. These permit the DBA staff to control indexing choices and mapping of data to storage. For a true three-schema architecture, we would need a third language, the view definition language  (VDL ), to specify user views and their mappings to the conceptual schema, but in most DBMSs the DDL is used to define both conceptual and external schemas .\n",
      "\n",
      "In relational DBMSs, SQL is used in the role of VDL to define user or application views  as results of predefined queries (see Chapters 6 and 7). Once the database schemas are compiled and the database is populated with data, users must have some means to manipulate the database. Typical manipulations include retrieval, insertion, deletion, and modification of the data. The DBMS pro-vides a set of operations or a language called the data manipulation language (DML ) for these purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In current DBMSs, the preceding types of languages are usually not considered dis- tinct languages ; rather, a comprehensive integrated language is used that includes constructs for conceptual schema definition, view definition, and data manipula-tion. Storage definition is typically kept separate, since it is used for defining physi-cal storage structures to fine-tune the performance of the database system, which is usually done by the DBA staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "A typical example of a comprehensive database lan-guage is the SQL relational database language (see Chapters 6 and 7), which repre-sents a combination of DDL, VDL, and DML, as well as statements for constraint specification, schema evolution, and many other features. The SDL was a compo-nent in early versions of SQL but has been removed from the language to keep it at the conceptual and external levels only. There are two main types of DMLs.\n",
      "\n",
      "A high-level  or nonprocedural  DML can be used on its own to specify complex database operations concisely. Many DBMSs allow high-level DML statements either to be entered interactively from a display monitor or terminal or to be embedded in a general-purpose programming lan- guage. In the latter case, DML statements must be identified within the program so 40 Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture that they can be extracted by a precompiler and processed by the DBMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "A low- level  or procedural  DML must  be embedded in a general-purpose programming language. This type of DML typically retrieves individual records or objects from the database and processes each separately. Therefore, it needs to use programming language constructs, such as looping, to retrieve and process each record from a set of records. Low-level DMLs are also called record-at-a-time  DMLs because of this property.\n",
      "\n",
      "High-level DMLs, such as SQL, can specify and retrieve many records in a single DML statement; therefore, they are called set-at-a-time  or set-oriented DMLs. A query in a high-level DML often specifies which  data to retrieve rather than how to retrieve it; therefore, such languages are also called declarative . Whenever DML commands, whether high level or low level, are embedded in a general-purpose programming language, that language is called the host language and the DML is called the data sublanguage .\n",
      "\n",
      "10 On the other hand, a high-level DML used in a standalone interactive manner is called a query language . In gen- eral, both retrieval and update commands of a high-level DML may be used inter-actively and are hence considered part of the query language. 11 Casual end users typically use a high-level query language to specify their requests, whereas programmers use the DML in its embedded form.\n",
      "\n",
      "For naive and paramet-ric users, there usually are user-friendly interfaces  for interacting with the data- base; these can also be used by casual users or others who do not want to learn the details of a high-level query language. We discuss these types of interfaces next.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.3.2 DBMS Interfaces User-friendly interfaces provided by a DBMS may include the following: Menu-based Interfaces for Web Clients or Browsing. These interfaces pres- ent the user with lists of options (called menus)  that lead the user through the for- mulation of a request. Menus do away with the need to memorize the specific commands and syntax of a query language; rather, the query is composed step-by-step by picking options from a menu that is displayed by the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pull-down menus are a very popular technique in Web-based user interfaces . They are also often used in browsing interfaces , which allow a user to look through the contents of a database in an exploratory and unstructured manner. Apps for Mobile Devices. These interfaces present mobile users with access to their data. For example, banking, reservations, and insurance companies, among many others, provide apps that allow users to access their data through a mobile phone or mobile device.\n",
      "\n",
      "The apps have built-in programmed interfaces that typically 10In object databases, the host and data sublanguages typically form one integrated language—for example, C++ with some extensions to support database functionality. Some relational systems also provide integrated languages—for example, Oracle’s PL/SQL. 11According to the English meaning of the word query , it should really be used to describe retrievals only, not updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.3 Database Languages and Interfaces  41 allow users to login using their account name and password; the apps then provide a limited menu of options for mobile access to the user data, as well as options such as paying bills (for banks) or making reservations (for reservation Web sites). Forms-based Interfaces. A forms-based interface displays a form to each user.\n",
      "\n",
      "Users can fill out all of the form  entries to insert new data, or they can fill out only certain entries, in which case the DBMS will retrieve matching data for the remain-ing entries. Forms are usually designed and programmed for naive users as inter-faces to canned transactions. Many DBMSs have forms specification languages , which are special languages that help programmers specify such forms. SQL*Forms is a form-based language that specifies queries using a form designed in conjunc-tion with the relational database schema.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oracle Forms is a component of the Ora-cle product suite that provides an extensive set of features to design and build applications using forms. Some systems have utilities that define a form by letting the end user interactively construct a sample form on the screen. Graphical User Interfaces. A GUI typically displays a schema to the user in dia- grammatic form. The user then can specify a query by manipulating the diagram. In many cases, GUIs utilize both menus and forms. Natural Language Interfaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "These interfaces accept requests written in Eng- lish or some other language and attempt to understand  them. A natural language interface usually has its own schema , which is similar to the database conceptual schema, as well as a dictionary of important words. The natural language interface refers to the words in its schema, as well as to the set of standard words in its dic-tionary, that are used to interpret the request.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the interpretation is successful, the interface generates a high-level query corresponding to the natural language request and submits it to the DBMS for processing; otherwise, a dialogue is started with the user to clarify the request. Keyword-based Database Search. These are somewhat similar to Web search engines, which accept strings of natural language (like English or Spanish) words and match them with documents at specific sites (for local search engines) or Web pages on the Web at large (for engines like Google or Ask).\n",
      "\n",
      "They use predefined indexes on words and use ranking functions to retrieve and present resulting docu-ments in a decreasing degree of match. Such “free form” textual query interfaces are not yet common in structured relational databases, although a research area called keyword-based querying  has emerged recently for relational databases. Speech Input and Output. Limited use of speech as an input query and speech as an answer to a question or result of a request is becoming commonplace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Appli-cations with limited vocabularies, such as inquiries for telephone directory, flight arrival/departure, and credit card account information, are allowing speech for input and output to enable customers to access this information. The speech input is detected using a library of predefined words and used to set up the parameters that are supplied to the queries. For output, a similar conversion from text or num-bers into speech takes place.42 Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture Interfaces for Parametric Users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parametric users, such as bank tellers, often have a small set of operations that they must perform repeatedly. For example, a teller is able to use single function keys to invoke routine and repetitive transactions such as account deposits or withdrawals, or balance inquiries. Systems analysts and programmers design and implement a special interface for each known class of naive users. Usually a small set of abbreviated commands is included, with the goal of minimizing the number of keystrokes required for each request. Interfaces for the DBA.\n",
      "\n",

Reducing disk read/write improves performance consid-erably.

The DDL compiler processes schema definitions, specified in the DDL, and stores descriptions of the schemas (meta-data) in the DBMS catalog.\n",

Among other things, the query optimizer  is concerned with the rearrangement and possible reordering of operations, elimina-tion of redundancies, and use of efficient search algorithms during execution. It consults the system catalog for statistical and other physical information about the stored data and generates executable code that performs the necessary operations for the query and makes calls on the runtime processor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Application programmers write programs in host languages such as Java, C, or C++ that are submitted to a precompiler. The precompiler  extracts DML commands from an application program written in a host programming language. These com-mands are sent to the DML compiler for compilation into object code for database access. The rest of the program is sent to the host language compiler. The object codes for the DML commands and the rest of the program are linked, forming a canned transaction whose executable code includes calls to the runtime database processor.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also becoming increasingly common to use scripting languages such as PHP and Python to write database programs. Canned transactions are executed repeatedly by parametric users via PCs or mobile apps; these users simply supply the parameters to the transactions. Each execution is considered to be a separate transaction. An example is a bank payment transaction where the account number, payee, and amount may be supplied as parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the lower part of Figure 2.3, the runtime database processor  executes (1) the privileged commands, (2) the executable query plans, and (3) the canned transac-tions with runtime parameters. It works with the system catalog  and may update it with statistics. It also works with the stored data manager , which in turn uses basic operating system services for carrying out low-level input/output (read/write) operations between the disk and main memory. The runtime database processor handles other aspects of data transfer, such as management of buffers in the main memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some DBMSs have their own buffer management module whereas others depend on the OS for buffer management. We have shown concurrency control and backup and recovery systems  separately as a module in this figure. They are integrated into the working of the runtime database processor for purposes of transaction management. It is common to have the client program  that accesses the DBMS running on a separate computer or device from the computer on which the database resides. The former is called the client computer  running DBMS client software and the latter is called the database server .\n",
      "\n",
      "In many cases, the client accesses a middle computer, called the application server , which in turn accesses the database server. We elabo- rate on this topic in Section 2.5. Figure 2.3 is not meant to describe a specific DBMS; rather, it illustrates typical DBMS modules. The DBMS interacts with the operating system when disk accesses—to the database or to the catalog—are needed. If the computer system is shared by many users, the OS will schedule DBMS disk access requests and DBMS processing along with other processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, if the computer system is mainly dedicated to running the database server, the DBMS will control main memory  2.4 The Database System Environment  45 buffering of disk pages. The DBMS also interfaces with compilers for general- purpose host programming languages, and with application servers and client pro-grams running on separate machines through the system network interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.4.2 Database System Utilities In addition to possessing the software modules just described, most DBMSs have database utilities  that help the DBA manage the database system. Common utili- ties have the following types of functions: ■ Loading. A loading utility is used to load existing data files—such as text files or sequential files—into the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually, the current (source) for-mat of the data file and the desired (target) database file structure are speci-fied to the utility, which then automatically reformats the data and stores it in the database. With the proliferation of DBMSs, transferring data from one DBMS to another is becoming common in many organizations. Some vendors offer conversion tools  that generate the appropriate loading pro- grams, given the existing source and target database storage descriptions (internal schemas). ■ Backup.\n",
      "\n",
      "A backup utility creates a backup copy of the database, usually by dumping the entire database onto tape or other mass storage medium. The backup copy can be used to restore the database in case of catastrophic disk failure. Incremental backups are also often used, where only changes since the previous backup are recorded. Incremental backup is more complex, but saves storage space. ■ Database storage reorganization. This utility can be used to reorganize a set of database files into different file organizations and create new access paths to improve performance. ■ Performance monitoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a utility monitors database usage and pro- vides statistics to the DBA. The DBA uses the statistics in making decisions such as whether or not to reorganize files or whether to add or drop indexes to improve performance. Other utilities may be available for sorting files, handling data compression, monitoring access by users, interfacing with the network, and performing other functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.4.3  Tools, Application Environments, and Communications Facilities Other tools are often available to database designers, users, and the DBMS. CASE tools12 are used in the design phase of database systems. Another tool that can be quite useful in large organizations is an expanded data dictionary  (or data repository ) 12Although CASE stands for computer-aided software engineering, many CASE tools are used primarily for database design.46 Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture system .\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to storing catalog information about schemas and  constraints, the data dictionary stores other information, such as design decisions, usage stan-dards, application program descriptions, and user information. Such a system is also called an information repository . This information can be accessed directly  by users or the DBA when needed. A data dictionary utility is similar to the DBMS catalog, but it includes a wider variety of information and is accessed mainly by users rather than by the DBMS software.\n",
      "\n",
      "Application development environments , such as PowerBuilder (Sybase) or JBuilder (Borland), have been quite popular. These systems provide an environ-ment for developing database applications and include facilities that help in many facets of database systems, including database design, GUI development, querying and updating, and application program development. The DBMS also needs to interface with communications software , whose function is to allow users at locations remote from the database system site to access the database through computer terminals, workstations, or personal computers.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are connected to the database site through data communications hardware such as Internet routers, phone lines, long-haul networks, local networks, or satellite com-munication devices. Many commercial database systems have communication packages that work with the DBMS. The integrated DBMS and data communica-tions system is called a DB/DC  system. In addition, some distributed DBMSs are physically distributed over multiple machines. In this case, communications net-works are needed to connect the machines.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are often local area networks (LANs) , but they can also be other types of networks.\n",

      "\n",
      "2.5.1 Centralized DBMSs Architecture Architectures for DBMSs have followed trends similar to those for general com- puter system architectures. Older architectures used mainframe computers to pro- vide the main processing for all system functions, including user application programs and user interface programs, as well as all the DBMS functionality. The reason was that in older systems, most users accessed the DBMS via computer ter-minals that did not have processing power and only provided display capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, all processing was performed remotely on the computer system housing the DBMS, and only display information and controls were sent from the computer to the display terminals, which were connected to the central computer via various types of communications networks. As prices of hardware declined, most users replaced their terminals with PCs and workstations, and more recently with mobile devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, database systems used these computers similarly to how they had used display terminals, so that the DBMS itself was still a centralized  DBMS in which all the DBMS functionality,  2.5 Centralized and Client/Server Architectures for DBMSs  47 application program execution, and user interface processing were carried out on one machine. Figure 2.4 illustrates the physical components in a centralized archi-tecture. Gradually, DBMS systems started to exploit the available processing power at the user side, which led to client/server DBMS architectures.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.5.2 Basic Client/Server Architectures First, we discuss client/server architecture in general; then we discuss how it is applied to DBMSs. The client/server architecture  was developed to deal with com- puting environments in which a large number of PCs, workstations, file servers, printers, database servers, Web servers, e-mail servers, and other software and equipment are connected via a network. The idea is to define specialized servers with specific functionalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, it is possible to connect a number of PCs or small workstations as clients to a file server  that maintains the files of the client machines. Another machine can be designated as a printer server  by being con- nected to various printers; all print requests by the clients are forwarded to this machine. Web servers  or e-mail servers  also fall into the specialized server cate- gory. The resources provided by specialized servers can be accessed by many client machines.\n",
      "\n",
      "The client machines  provide the user with the appropriate interfaces to utilize these servers, as well as with local processing power to run local applications. This concept can be carried over to other software packages, with specialized pro- grams—such as a CAD (computer-aided design) package—being stored on specific server machines and being made accessible to multiple clients.

Some machines would be client sites only (for example, mobile devices or workstations/PCs that have only client software installed).\n",
      "\n",
      "Other machines would be dedicated servers, and others would have both client and server functionality. The concept of client/server architecture assumes an underlying framework that consists of many PCs/workstations and mobile devices as well as a smaller number of server machines, connected via wireless networks or LANs and other types of computer networks. A client  in this framework is typically a user machine that pro- vides user interface capabilities and local processing. When a client requires access to additional functionality—such as database access—that does not exist at the cli- ent, it connects to a server that provides the needed functionality.\n",
      "\n",
      "A server  is a sys- tem containing both hardware and software that can provide services to the client machines, such as file access, printing, archiving, or database access.

Two main types of basic DBMS architectures were created on this under- lying client/server framework: two-tier  and three-tier .13 We discuss them next.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.5.3 Two-Tier Client/Server Architectures for DBMSs In relational database management systems (RDBMSs), many of which started as centralized systems, the system components that were first moved to the  client side were the user interface and application programs. Because SQL (see Chapters 6 and 7) provided a standard language for RDBMSs, this created a logical dividing point between client and server. Hence, the query and transac-tion functionality related to SQL processing remained on the server side.\n",
      "\n",
      "In such an architecture, the server is often called a query server  or transaction server  because it provides these two functionalities. In an RDBMS, the server is also often called an SQL server . The user interface programs and application programs can run on the client side. When DBMS access is required, the program establishes a connection to the DBMS (which is on the server side); once the connection is created, the client program can communicate with the DBMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "A standard called Open Database Connectivity  (ODBC ) provides an application programming interface  (API ), which allows client-side programs to call the DBMS, as long as both client and server machines have the necessary software installed. Most DBMS vendors pro-vide ODBC drivers for their systems. A client program can actually connect to several RDBMSs and send query and transaction requests using the ODBC API, which are then processed at the server sites. Any query results are sent back to the client program, which can process and display the results as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A related standard for the Java programming language, called JDBC , has also been defined. This allows Java client programs to access one or more DBMSs through a stan-dard interface. The architectures described here are called two-tier architectures  because the soft- ware components are distributed over two systems: client and server. The advan-tages of this architecture are its simplicity and seamless compatibility with existing systems. The emergence of the Web changed the roles of clients and servers, leading to the three-tier architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.5.4  Three-Tier and n-Tier Architectures for Web Applications Many Web applications use an architecture called the three-tier architecture , which adds an intermediate layer between the client and the database server, as illustrated in Figure 2.7(a). 13There are many other variations of client/server architectures. We discuss the two most basic ones here.50 Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture This intermediate layer or middle tier  is called the application server  or the Web server , depending on the application.\n",
      "\n",
      "This server plays an intermediary role by running application programs and storing business rules (procedures or con-straints) that are used to access data from the database server. It can also improve database security by checking a client’s credentials before forwarding a request to the database server. Clients contain user interfaces and Web browsers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inter-mediate server accepts requests from the client, processes the request and sends database queries and commands to the database server, and then acts as a conduit for passing (partially) processed data from the database server to the clients, where it may be processed further and filtered to be presented to the users. Thus, the user interface, application rules,  and data access  act as the three tiers. Figure 2.7(b) shows another view of the three-tier architecture used by database and other application package vendors. The presentation layer displays information to the user and allows data entry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The business logic layer handles intermediate rules and constraints before data is passed up to the user or down to the DBMS. The bottom layer includes all data management services. The middle layer can also act as a Web server, which retrieves query results from the database server and formats them into dynamic Web pages that are viewed by the Web browser at the client side. The client machine is typically a PC or mobile device connected to the Web. Other architectures have also been proposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is possible to divide the layers between the user and the stored data further into finer components, thereby giving rise to n-tier architectures, where n may be four or five tiers. Typically, the business logic layer is divided into multiple layers. Besides distributing programming and data throughout a network, n-tier applications afford the advantage that any one tier can run on an appropriate processor or operating system platform and can be handled independently.\n",

      "2.6 Classification of Database Management Systems  51 accounts for the front-end modules (clients) communicating with a number of back-end databases (servers). Advances in encryption and decryption technology make it safer to transfer sensi- tive data from server to client in encrypted form, where it will be decrypted. The latter can be done by the hardware or by advanced software. This technology gives higher levels of data security, but the network security issues remain a major con-cern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Various technologies for data compression also help to transfer large amounts of data from servers to clients over wired and wireless networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.6  Classification of Database   Management Systems Several criteria can be used to classify DBMSs. The first is the data model  on which the DBMS is based. The main data model used in many current commercial DBMSs is the relational data model , and the systems based on this model are known as SQL systems. The object data model  has been implemented in some commercial systems but has not had widespread use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, so-called big data systems,  also known as key-value storage systems  and NOSQL systems,  use vari- ous data models: document-based,  graph-based,  column-based,  and key-value data models. Many legacy applications still run on database systems based on the hierarchical  and network data models . The relational DBMSs are evolving continuously, and, in particular, have been incorporating many of the concepts that were developed in object databases.\n",
      "\n",
      "This has led to a new class of DBMSs called object-relational DBMS s. We can catego- rize DBMSs based on the data model: relational, object, object-relational, NOSQL, key-value, hierarchical, network, and other. Some experimental DBMSs are based on the XML (eXtended Markup Language) model, which is a tree-structured data model. These have been called native XML DBMSs. Several commercial relational DBMSs have added XML interfaces and storage to their products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second criterion used to classify DBMSs is the number of users  supported by the system. Single-user systems  support only one user at a time and are mostly used with PCs. Multiuser systems , which include the majority of DBMSs, support concurrent multiple users. The third criterion is the number of sites  over which the database is distributed. A DBMS is centralized  if the data is stored at a single computer site. A centralized DBMS can support multiple users, but the DBMS and the database reside totally at a single computer site.\n",
      "\n",
      "A distributed  DBMS (DDBMS) can have the actual database and DBMS software distributed over many sites connected by a computer network. Big data systems are often massively distributed, with hundreds of sites. The data is often replicated on multiple sites so that failure of a site will not make some data unavailable.52 Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture Homogeneous  DDBMSs use the same DBMS software at all the sites, whereas heterogeneous  DDBMSs can use different DBMS software at each site.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also possible to develop middleware software  to access several autonomous preexisting databases stored under heterogeneous DBMSs. This leads to a federated  DBMS (or multidatabase system ), in which the participating DBMSs are loosely coupled and have a degree of local autonomy. Many DDBMSs use client-server architecture, as we described in Section 2.5. The fourth criterion is cost. It is difficult to propose a classification of DBMSs based on cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today we have open source (free) DBMS products like MySQL and PostgreSQL that are supported by third-party vendors with additional services. The main RDBMS products are available as free examination 30-day copy versions as well as personal versions, which may cost under $100 and allow a fair amount of functionality. The giant systems are being sold in modular form with components to handle distribution, replication, parallel processing, mobile capability, and so on, and with a large number of parameters that must be defined for the configura-tion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, they are sold in the form of licenses—site licenses allow unlim-ited use of the database system with any number of copies running at the customer site. Another type of license limits the number of concurrent users or the number of user seats at a location. Standalone single-user versions of some systems like Microsoft Access are sold per copy or included in the overall configuration of a desktop or laptop. In addition, data warehousing and mining features, as well as support for additional data types, are made available at extra cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is possible to pay millions of dollars for the installation and maintenance of large database sys-tems annually. We can also classify a DBMS on the basis of the types of access path  options for storing files. One well-known family of DBMSs is based on inverted file structures. Finally, a DBMS can be general purpose  or special purpose . When performance is a primary consideration, a special-purpose DBMS can be designed and built for a specific application; such a system cannot be used for other applications without major changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many airline reservations and telephone directory systems devel-oped in the past are special-purpose DBMSs. These fall into the category of online transaction processing  (OLTP ) systems, which must support a large number of concurrent transactions without imposing excessive delays. Let us briefly elaborate on the main criterion for classifying DBMSs: the data model. The relational data model  represents a database as a collection of tables, where each table can be stored as a separate file. The database in Figure 1.2 resem-bles a basic relational representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most relational databases use the high-level query language called SQL and support a limited form of user views. We discuss the relational model and its languages and operations in Chapters 5 through 8, and techniques for programming relational applications in Chapters 10 and 11. The object data model  defines a database in terms of objects, their properties, and their operations. Objects with the same structure and behavior belong to a class , and classes are organized into hierarchies  (or acyclic graphs ).\n",
      "\n",
      "The operations of  2.6 Classification of Database Management Systems  53 each class are specified in terms of predefined procedures called methods . Rela- tional DBMSs have been extending their models to incorporate object database concepts and other capabilities; these systems are referred to as object-relational  or extended relational systems . We discuss object databases and object-relational systems in Chapter 12. Big data systems are based on various data models, with the following four data models most common.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key-value data model  associates a unique key with each value (which can be a record or object) and provides very fast access to a value given its key. The document data model  is based on JSON (Java Script Object Notation) and stores the data as documents, which somewhat resemble complex objects. The graph data model  stores objects as graph nodes and rela- tionships among objects as directed graph edges. Finally, the column-based data models  store the columns of rows clustered on disk pages for fast access and allow multiple versions of the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will discuss some of these in more detail in Chapter 24. The XML model  has emerged as a standard for exchanging data over the Web and has been used as a basis for implementing several prototype native XML systems. XML uses hierarchical tree structures. It combines database concepts with concepts from document representation models. Data is represented as elements; with the use of tags, data can be nested to create complex tree structures. This model con-ceptually resembles the object model but uses different terminology.\n",
      "\n",
      "XML capabili-ties have been added to many commercial DBMS products. We present an overview of XML in Chapter 13. Two older, historically important data models, now known as legacy data models , are the network and hierarchical models. The network model  represents data as record types and also represents a limited type of 1:N relationship, called a set type . A 1:N, or one-to-many, relationship relates one instance of a record to many record instances using some pointer linking mechanism in these models.\n",
      "\n",
      "The network model, also known as the CODASYL DBTG model, 14 has an associated record-at- a-time language that must be embedded in a host programming language. The net- work DML was proposed in the 1971 Database Task Group (DBTG) Report as an extension of the COBOL language. The hierarchical model  represents data as hierarchical tree structures. Each hierar- chy represents a number of related records. There is no standard language for the hierarchical model.\n",
      "\n",
      "A popular hierarchical DML is DL/1 of the IMS system. It dom-inated the DBMS market for over 20 years between 1965 and 1985. Its DML, called DL/1, was a de facto industry standard for a long time. 15 14CODASYL DBTG stands for Conference on Data Systems Languages Database Task Group, which is the committee that specified the network model and its language.\n",

      "2.7 Summary   In this chapter we introduced the main concepts used in database systems. We defined a data model and we distinguished three main categories: ■ High-level or conceptual data models (based on entities and relationships) ■ Low-level or physical data models ■ Representational or implementation data models (record-based, object- oriented) We distinguished the schema, or description of a database, from the database itself. The schema does not change very often, whereas the database state changes every time data is inserted, deleted, or modified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we described the three-schema DBMS architecture, which allows three schema levels: ■ An internal schema describes the physical storage structure of the database. ■ A conceptual schema is a high-level description of the whole database. ■ External schemas describe the views of different user groups. A DBMS that cleanly separates the three levels must have mappings among the schemas to transform requests and query results from one level to the next. Most DBMSs do not separate the three levels completely. We used the three-schema architecture to define the concepts of logical and physical data independence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we discussed the main types of languages and interfaces that DBMSs support. A data definition language (DDL) is used to define the database conceptual schema. In most DBMSs, the DDL also defines user views and, sometimes, storage struc-tures; in other DBMSs, separate languages or functions exist for specifying storage structures. This distinction is fading away in today’s relational implementations, with SQL serving as a catchall language to perform multiple roles, including view definition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The storage definition part (SDL) was included in SQL’s early versions, but is now typically implemented as special commands for the DBA in relational DBMSs. The DBMS compiles all schema definitions and stores their descriptions in the DBMS catalog. A data manipulation language (DML) is used for specifying database retrievals and updates. DMLs can be high level (set-oriented, nonprocedural) or low level (record-oriented, procedural).\n",
      "\n",
      "A high-level DML can be embedded in a host programming language, or it can be used as a standalone language; in the latter case it is often called a query language. We discussed different types of interfaces provided by DBMSs and the types of DBMS users with which each interface is associated. Then we discussed the database system environment, typical DBMS software modules, and DBMS utilities for helping users and the DBA staff perform their tasks. We continued with an overview of the two-tier and three-tier architectures for database  applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conceptual modeling is a very important phase in designing a successful database application. Generally, the term database application refers to a particular database and the associated programs that implement the database queries and updates. For example, a BANK database application that keeps track of customer accounts would include programs that implement database updates corresponding to customer deposits and withdrawals. These programs would provide user-friendly graphical user interfaces (GUIs) utilizing forms and menus for the end users of the application—the bank customers or bank tellers in this example.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, it is now common to provide interfaces to these programs to BANK customers via mobile devices using mobile apps. Hence, a major part of the database application will require the design, implementation, and testing of these application programs. Traditionally, the design and testing of application programs has been considered to be part of software engineering rather than database design. In many software design tools, the database design methodologies and software engineering methodologies are intertwined since these activities are strongly related. In this chapter, we follow the traditional approach of concentrating on the database structures and constraints during conceptual database design.\n",
      "\n",
      "The design of application programs is typically covered in software engineering courses. We present the modeling concepts of the entity–relationship (ER) model, which is a popular high-level conceptual data model. This model and its variations are frequently used for the conceptual design of database applications, and many database design tool employ its concepts. We describe the basic data-structuring concepts and constraints of the ER model and discuss their use in the design of conceptual schemas for database applications. We also present the diagrammatic notation associated with the ER model, known as ER diagrams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Object modeling methodologies such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML) are becoming increasingly popular in both database and software design. These methodologies go beyond database design to specify detailed design of software modules and their interactions using various types of diagrams. An important part of these methodologies—namely, class diagrams1 is similar in many ways to the ER diagrams. In class diagrams, operations on objects are specified, in addition to specifying the database schema structure. Operations can be used to specify the functional requirements during database design, as we will discuss in Section 3.1.\n",
      "\n",
      "We present some of the UML notation and concepts for class diagrams that are particularly relevant to database design in Section 3.8, and we briefly compare these to ER notation and concepts. Additional UML notation and concepts are presented in Section 4.6. This chapter is organized as follows: Section 3.1 discusses the role of high-level con- ceptual data models in database design. We introduce the requirements for a sam- ple database application in Section 3.2 to illustrate the use of concepts from the ER model. This sample database is used throughout the text.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Section 3.3 we present the concepts of entities and attributes, and we gradually introduce the diagrammatic technique for displaying an ER schema. In Section 3.4 we introduce the concepts of binary relationships and their roles and structural constraints. Section 3.5 introduces weak entity types.

      "The material in Sections 3.8 and 3.9 may be excluded from an introductory course. If a more thorough coverage of data modeling concepts and conceptual database design is desired, the reader should continue to Chapter 4, where we describe extensions to the ER model that lead to the enhanced–ER (EER) model, which includes concepts such as specialization, generalization, inheritance, and union types (categories).\n",

      "3.1  Using High-Level Conceptual Data Models for Database Design Figure 3.1 shows a simplified overview of the database design process. The first step shown is requirements collection and analysis . During this step, the database designers interview prospective database users to understand and document their data requirements . The result of this step is a concisely written set of users’ require- ments. These requirements should be specified in as detailed and complete a form as possible. In parallel with specifying the data requirements, it is useful to specify the known functional requirements  of the application.\n",
      "\n",
      "These consist of the user- defined operations  (or transactions ) that will be applied to the database, including both retrievals and updates. In software design, it is common to use data flow dia- grams , sequence diagrams , scenarios , and other techniques to specify functional requirements. We will not discuss any of these techniques here; they are usually described in detail in software engineering texts. Once the requirements have been collected and analyzed, the next step is to create a conceptual schema  for the database, using a high-level conceptual data model. This step is called conceptual design .\n",
      "\n",
      "The conceptual schema is a concise description of the data requirements of the users and includes detailed descriptions of the entity types, relationships, and constraints; these are expressed using the concepts pro-vided by the high-level data model. Because these concepts do not include imple-mentation details, they are usually easier to understand and can be used to communicate with nontechnical users. The high-level conceptual schema can also be used as a reference to ensure that all users’ data requirements are met and that the requirements do not conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach enables database designers to con-centrate on specifying the properties of the data, without being concerned with storage and implementation details, which makes it is easier to create a good con-ceptual database design. During or after the conceptual schema design, the basic data model operations can be used to specify the high-level user queries and operations identified during functional analysis. This also serves to confirm that the conceptual schema meets all the identified functional requirements. Modifications to the conceptual schema can be introduced if some functional requirements cannot be specified using the initial schema.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next step in database design is the actual implementation of the database, using a commercial DBMS. Most current commercial DBMSs use an implementation data model—such as the relational (SQL) model—so the conceptual schema is transformed from the high-level data model into the implementation data model. This step is called logical design  or data model mapping ; its result is a database schema in the implementation data model of the DBMS. Data model mapping is often automated or semiautomated within the database design tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last step is the physical design  phase, during which the internal storage struc- tures, file organizations, indexes, access paths, and physical design parameters for the database files are specified. In parallel with these activities, application pro-grams are designed and implemented as database transactions corresponding to the high-level transaction specifications. We present only the basic ER model concepts for conceptual schema design in this chapter. Additional modeling concepts are discussed in Chapter 4, when we intro-duce the EER model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.2 A Sample Database Application   In this section we describe a sample database application, called COMPANY , which serves to illustrate the basic ER model concepts and their use in schema design. We list the data requirements for the database here, and then create its conceptual schema step-by-step as we introduce the modeling concepts of the ER model. The COMPANY  database keeps track of a company’s employees, departments, and projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose that after the requirements collection and analysis phase, the database designers provide the following description of the miniworld —the part of the company that will be represented in the database. 3.3 Entity Types, Entity Sets, Attributes, and Keys  63 ■ The company is organized into departments. Each department has a unique name, a unique number, and a particular employee who manages the depart-ment. We keep track of the start date when that employee began managing the department. A department may have several locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "■ A department controls a number of projects, each of which has a unique name, a unique number, and a single location. ■ The database will store each employee’s name, Social Security number,2 address, salary, sex (gender), and birth date. An employee is assigned to one department, but may work on several projects, which are not necessarily controlled by the same department. It is required to keep track of the cur-rent number of hours per week that an employee works on each project, as well as the direct supervisor of each employee (who is another employee).\n",
      "\n",
      "■ The database will keep track of the dependents of each employee for insur- ance purposes, including each dependent’s first name, sex, birth date, and relationship to the employee. Figure 3.2 shows how the schema for this database application can be displayed by means of the graphical notation known as ER diagrams . This figure will be explained gradually as the ER model concepts are presented. We describe the step- by-step process of deriving this schema from the stated requirements—and explain the ER diagrammatic notation—as we introduce the ER model concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.3  Entity Types, Entity Sets, Attributes,   and Keys The ER model describes data as entities , relationships , and attributes . In  Section 3.3.1 we introduce the concepts of entities and their attributes. We discuss entity types and key attributes in Section 3.3.2. Then, in Section 3.3.3, we specify the initial con-ceptual design of the entity types for the COMPANY  database. We describe relation- ships in Section 3.4.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.3.1 Entities and Attributes Entities and Their Attributes. The basic concept that the ER model represents is an entity , which is a thing  or object  in the real world with an independent existence. An entity may be an object with a physical existence (for example, a particular per-son, car, house, or employee) or it may be an object with a conceptual existence (for instance, a company, a job, or a university course). Each entity has attributes —the particular properties that describe it.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, an EMPLOYEE  entity may be described by the employee’s name, age, address, salary, and job. A particular entity 2The Social Security number, or SSN, is a unique nine-digit identifier assigned to each individual in the United States to keep track of his or her employment, benefits, and taxes. Other countries may have similar identification schemes, such as personal identification card numbers.64 Chapter 3 Data Modeling Using the Entity–Relationship (ER) Model will have a value for each of its attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The attribute values that describe each entity become a major part of the data stored in the database. Figure 3.3 shows two entities and the values of their attributes. The EMPLOYEE entity e1 has four attributes: Name , Address , Age, and Home_phone ; their values are ‘John Smith,’ ‘2311 Kirby, Houston, Texas 77001’, ‘55’, and ‘713-749-2630’, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "The COMPANY  entity c1 has three attributes: Name , Headquarters , and President ; their values are ‘Sunco Oil’, ‘Houston’, and ‘John Smith’, respectively. An ER schema diagram for the COMPANY database. The diagrammatic notation is introduced gradually throughout this chapter and is summarized in Figure 3.14.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.3 Entity Types, Entity Sets, Attributes, and Keys  65 Several types of attributes occur in the ER model: simple  versus composite , single- valued  versus multivalued , and stored  versus derived . First we define these attribute types and illustrate their use via examples. Then we discuss the concept of a NULL value  for an attribute. Composite versus Simple (Atomic) Attributes. Composite attributes  can be divided into smaller subparts, which represent more basic attributes with indepen-dent meanings.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the Address  attribute of the EMPLOYEE  entity shown in Figure 3.3 can be subdivided into Street_address , City, State , and Zip,3 with the values ‘2311 Kirby’, ‘Houston’, ‘Texas’, and ‘77001’. Attributes that are not divisible are called simple  or atomic attributes .\n",
      "\n",
      "Composite attributes can form a hierarchy; for example, Street_address  can be further subdivided into three simple component attributes: Number , Street , and Apartment_number , as shown in Figure 3.4. The value of a composite attribute is the concatenation of the values of its component simple attributes. Composite attributes are useful to model situations in which a user sometimes refers to the composite attribute as a unit but at other times refers specifically to its components. If the composite attribute is referenced only as a whole, there is no need to subdivide it into component attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if there is no need to refer to the individual components of an address (Zip Code, street, and so on), then the whole address can be designated as a simple attribute. Single-Valued versus Multivalued Attributes. Most attributes have a single value for a particular entity; such attributes are called single-valued . For example, Age is a single-valued attribute of a person.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases an attribute can have a set of values for the same entity—for instance, a Colors  attribute for a car, or a College_degrees  attribute for a person. Cars with one color have a single value, whereas two-tone cars have two color values. Similarly, one person may not have any college degrees, another person may have one, and a third person may have two or more degrees; therefore, different people can have different numbers  of values  for the College_degrees  attribute. Such attributes are called multivalued .\n",
      "\n",
      "A multivalued attribute may have lower and upper bounds to constrain the number of values  allowed for each individual entity. For example, the Colors  attribute of a car may be restricted to have between one and two values, if we assume that a car can have two colors at most. Stored versus Derived Attributes. In some cases, two (or more) attribute val- ues are related—for example, the Age and Birth_date  attributes of a person.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a particular person entity, the value of Age can be determined from the current (today’s) date and the value of that person’s Birth_date . The Age attribute is hence called a derived attribute  and is said to be derivable from  the Birth_date  attribute, which is called a stored attribute . Some attribute values can be derived from related entities ; for example, an attribute Number_of_employees  of a DEPARTMENT  entity can be derived by counting the number of employees related to (working for) that department. NULL Values.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases, a particular entity may not have an applicable value for an attribute. For example, the Apartment_number  attribute of an address applies only to addresses that are in apartment buildings and not to other types of resi-dences, such as single-family homes. Similarly, a College_degrees  attribute applies only to people with college degrees. For such situations, a special value called NULL is created.\n",
      "\n",
      "An address of a single-family home would have NULL  for its Apartment_number  attribute, and a person with no college degree would have NULL  for College_degrees . NULL  can also be used if we do not know the value of an attribute for a particular entity—for example, if we do not know the home phone number of ‘John Smith’ in Figure 3.3. The meaning of the former type of NULL  is not applicable , whereas the meaning of the latter is unknown . The unknown  category of NULL  can be further classified into two cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first case arises when it is known that the attribute value exists but is missing —for instance, if the Height  attribute of a person is listed as NULL . The second case arises when it is not known  whether the attribute value exists—for example, if the Home_phone  attribute of a person is NULL . Complex Attributes. Notice that, in general, composite and multivalued attri- butes can be nested arbitrarily.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can represent arbitrary nesting by grouping  3.3 Entity Types, Entity Sets, Attributes, and Keys  67 components of a composite attribute between parentheses ( ) and separating the components with commas, and by displaying multivalued attributes between braces { }. Such attributes are called complex attributes . For example, if a person can have more than one residence and each residence can have a single address and multiple phones, an attribute Address_phone  for a person can be specified as shown in Figure 3.5.4 Both Phone  and Address  are themselves composite attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.3.2 Entity Types, Entity Sets, Keys, and Value Sets Entity Types and Entity Sets. A database usually contains groups of entities that are similar. For example, a company employing hundreds of employees may want to store similar information concerning each of the employees. These employee entities share the same attributes, but each entity has its own value (s) for each attribute. An entity type  defines a collection  (or set) of entities that have the same attributes. Each entity type in the database is described by its name and attributes.\n",

      "\n",
      "For example, EMPLOYEE  refers to both a type of entity  as well as the current collection of all employee entities  in the database. It is now more common to give separate names to the entity type and entity collection; for example in object and object-relational data models (see Chapter 12). An entity type is represented in ER diagrams 5 (see Figure 3.2) as a rectangular box enclosing the entity type name. Attribute names are enclosed in ovals and are attached to their entity type by straight lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Composite attributes are attached to their component attributes by straight lines. Multivalued attributes are displayed in double ovals. Figure 3.7(a) shows a CAR  entity type in this notation. An entity type describes the schema  or intension  for a set of entities  that share the same structure. The collection of entities of a particular entity type is grouped into an entity set, which is also called the extension  of the entity type. Key Attributes of an Entity Type.\n",
      "\n",
      "An important constraint on the entities of an entity type is the key or uniqueness constraint  on attributes. An entity type usually has one or more attributes whose values are distinct for each individual entity in the entity set. Such an attribute is called a key attribute , and its values can be used to identify each entity uniquely. For example, the Name attribute is a key of the COMPANY  entity type in Figure 3.6 because no two companies are allowed to have the same name.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the PERSON  entity type, a typical key attribute is Ssn (Social Secu- rity number). Sometimes several attributes together form a key, meaning that the combination  of the attribute values must be distinct for each entity. If a set of attri- butes possesses this property, the proper way to represent this in the ER model that we describe here is to define a composite attribute  and designate it as a key attribute of the entity type.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that such a composite key must be minimal ; that is, all component attributes must be included in the composite attribute to have the uniqueness property. Superfluous attributes must not be included in a key. In ER diagrammatic notation, each key attribute has its name underlined  inside the oval, as illustrated in Figure 3.7(a). Specifying that an attribute is a key of an entity type means that the preceding uniqueness property must hold for every entity set  of the entity type.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, it is a constraint that prohibits any two entities from having the same value for the key attribute at the same time. It is not the property of a particular entity set; rather, it is a constraint on any entity set  of the entity type at any point in time. This key con- straint (and other constraints we discuss later) is derived from the constraints of the miniworld that the database represents. Some entity types have more than one  key attribute.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, each of the Vehicle_id  and Registration  attributes of the entity type CAR  (Figure 3.7) is a key in 5We use a notation for ER diagrams that is close to the original proposed notation (Chen, 1976). Many other notations are in use; we illustrate some of them later in this chapter when we present UML class diagrams, and some additional diagrammatic notations are given in Appendix A.\n",

The Registration  attribute is an example of a composite key formed from two simple component attributes, State  and Number , neither of which is a key on its own. An entity type may also have no key , in which case it is called a weak entity type  (see Section 3.5). In our diagrammatic notation, if two attributes are underlined separately, then each is a key on its own .\n",
      "\n",

Alternatively, it can be represented as a multivalued composite attribute of PROJECT  called Workers  with the simple components ( Employee , Hours ).\n",

In the ER model, these references should not be represented as attributes but as relationships .\n",
      "\n",
      "The initial COMPANY  database schema from Figure 3.8 will be refined in Section 3.6 to represent relationships explicitly. In the initial design of entity types, relationships are typically captured in the form of attributes. As the design is refined, these attributes get converted into relationships between entity types. This section is organized as follows: Section 3.4.1 introduces the concepts of rela- tionship types, relationship sets, and relationship instances.\n",
      "\n",
      "We define the concepts of relationship degree, role names, and recursive relationships in Section 3.4.2, and then we discuss structural constraints on relationships—such as cardinality ratios and existence dependencies—in Section 3.4.3. Section 3.4.4 shows how relationship types can also have attributes.\n",

      "3.4.1 Relationship Types, Sets, and Instances A relationship type  R among n entity types E1, E2, . . . , En defines a set of associa- tions—or a relationship set —among entities from these entity types.\n",

      "Similar to the case of entity types and entity sets, a relationship type and its corresponding rela- tionship set are customarily referred to by the same name , R. Mathematically, the relationship set R is a set of relationship instances  ri, where each ri associates n individual entities ( e1, e2, . . . , en), and each entity ej in ri is a member of entity set Ej, 1 ≤ j ≤ n. Hence, a relationship set is a mathematical relation on E1, E2, . . .\n",

      "\n",
      "Informally, each relationship instance ri in R is an association of entities, where the association includes exactly one entity from each participating entity type. Each such relationship instance ri represents the fact that the entities participating in ri are related in some way in the corresponding miniworld situation.\n",

      "For example, consider a relationship type WORKS_FOR  between the two entity types   3.4 Relationship Types, Relationship Sets, Roles, and Structural Constraints  73 EMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT , which associates each employee with the depart- ment for which the employee works. Each relationship instance in the relationship set WORKS_FOR  associates one EMPLOYEE  entity and one DEPARTMENT entity.\n",

      "An example of a ternary relationship is SUPPLY , shown in Fig- ure 3.10, where each relationship instance ri associates three entities—a supplier s, a part p, and a project j—whenever s supplies part p to project j.

The value set of this Employees  attribute is the power set of the EMPLOYEE  entity set. Either of these two attributes— Department  of EMPLOYEE  or Employees  of DEPARTMENT —can represent the WORKS_FOR  relation- ship type.\n",
      "\n",
      "If both are represented, they are constrained to be inverses of each other. Some relationship instances in the  SUPPLY ternary relationship set. 8This concept of representing relationship types as attributes is used in a class of data models called functional data models . In object databases (see Chapter 12), relationships can be represented by reference attributes, either in one direction or in both directions as inverses. In relational databases (see Chapter 5), foreign keys are a type of reference attribute used to represent relationships.\n",

      "3.4 Relationship Types, Relationship Sets, Roles, and Structural Constraints  75 Role Names and Recursive Relationships. Each entity type that participates in a relationship type plays a particular role in the relationship. The role name  sig- nifies the role that a participating entity from the entity type plays in each relation-ship instance, and it helps to explain what the relationship means.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in the WORKS_FOR  relationship type, EMPLOYEE  plays the role of employee  or worker and DEPARTMENT  plays the role of department  or employer . Role names are not technically necessary in relationship types where all the partici- pating entity types are distinct, since each participating entity type name can be used as the role name. However, in some cases the same  entity type participates more than once in a relationship type in different roles .\n",
      "\n",
      "In such cases the role name becomes essential for distinguishing the meaning of the role that each participating entity plays. Such relationship types are called recursive relationships  or self-referencing relationships . Figure 3.11 shows an example. The SUPERVISION  relationship type relates an employee to a supervisor, where both employee and supervisor entities are members of the same EMPLOYEE  entity set.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, the EMPLOYEE  entity type participates twice  in SUPERVISION : once in the role of supervisor  (or boss), and once in the role of supervisee  (or subordinate ). Each relationship instance ri in SUPERVISION  associates two different employee entities ej and ek, one of which plays the role of supervisor and the other the role of supervisee.\n",

      "In Figure 3.11, the lines marked ‘1’ represent the supervisor role, and those marked ‘2’ represent the supervisee role; hence, e1 supervises e2 and e3, e4 supervises e6 and e7, and e5 super- vises e1 and e4. In this example, each relationship instance must be connected with two lines, one marked with ‘1’ (supervisor) and the other with ‘2’ (supervisee).\n",

      "3.4.3 Constraints on Binary Relationship Types Relationship types usually have certain constraints that limit the possible combina- tions of entities that may participate in the corresponding relationship set. These constraints are determined from the miniworld situation that the relationships rep-resent. For example, in Figure 3.9, if the company has a rule that each employee must work for exactly one department, then we would like to describe this con-straint in the schema. We can distinguish two main types of binary relationship constraints: cardinality ratio  and participation .\n",
      "\n",
      "Cardinality Ratios for Binary Relationships. The cardinality ratio  for a binary relationship specifies the maximum  number of relationship instances that an entity can participate in. For example, in the WORKS_FOR  binary relationship type, DEPARTMENT :EMPLOYEE  is of cardinality ratio 1:N, meaning that each department can be related to (that is, employs) any number of employees (N),9 but an employee can be related to (work for) at most one department (1).\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that for  this particular relationship type WORKS_FOR , a particular department entity can be related to any number of employees (N indicates there is no maximum number). On the other hand, an employee can be related to a maximum of one department. The possible cardinality ratios for binary relationship types are 1:1, 1:N, N:1,  and M:N. An example of a 1:1 binary relationship is MANAGES  (Figure 3.12), which relates a department entity to the employee who manages that department.\n",
      "\n",
      "This represents the miniworld constraints that—at any point in time—an employee can manage at 9N stands for any number  of related entities (zero or more). In some notations, the asterisk symbol (*) is used instead of most one department and a department can have at most one manager. The relationship type WORKS_ON  (Figure 3.13) is of cardinality ratio M:N, because the miniworld rule is that an employee can work on several projects and a project can have several employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cardinality ratios for binary relationships are represented on ER diagrams by dis- playing 1, M, and N on the diamonds as shown in Figure 3.2. Notice that in this notation, we can either specify no maximum (N) or a maximum of one (1) on par-ticipation. An alternative notation (see Section 3.7.4) allows the designer to specify a specific maximum number  on participation, such as 4 or 5. Participation Constraints and Existence Dependencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The participation constraint  specifies whether the existence of an entity depends on its being related to another entity via the relationship type. This constraint specifies the minimum number of relationship instances that each entity can participate in and is some- times called the minimum cardinality constraint . There are two types of participa- tion constraints—total and partial—that we illustrate by example. If a company policy states that every  employee must work for a department, then an employee entity can exist only if it participates in at least one WORKS_FOR  relationship instance (Figure 3.9).\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the participation of EMPLOYEE  in WORKS_FOR  is called total participation , meaning that every entity in the total set  of employee entities must be related to a department entity via WORKS_FOR . Total participation is also called existence dependency .\n",
      "\n",
      "In Figure 3.12 we do not expect every employee to manage a department, so the participation of EMPLOYEE  in the  EMPLOYEE MANAGES  relationship type is partial , meaning that some  or part of the set of employee entities are related to some department entity via MANAGES , but not necessarily all. We will refer to the cardinality ratio and participation constraints, taken together, as the structural constraints  of a relationship type.\n",
      "\n",
      "In ER diagrams, total participation (or existence dependency) is displayed as a double line connecting the participating entity type to the relationship, whereas partial par- ticipation is represented by a single line  (see Figure 3.2). Notice that in this notation, we can either specify no minimum (partial participation) or a minimum of one (total participation). An alternative notation (see Section 3.7.4) allows the designer to spec-ify a specific minimum number  on participation in the relationship, such as 4 or 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will discuss constraints on higher-degree relationships in Section 3.9.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.4.4 Attributes of Relationship Types Relationship types can also have attributes, similar to those of entity types. For example, to record the number of hours per week that a particular employee works on a particular project, we can include an attribute Hours  for the WORKS_ON relationship type in Figure 3.13. Another example is to include the date on which a manager started managing a department via an attribute Start_date  for the MANAGES  relationship type in Figure 3.12.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that attributes of 1:1 or 1:N relationship types can be migrated to one of the participating entity types. For example, the Start_date  attribute for the MANAGES relationship can be an attribute of either EMPLOYEE (manager)  or DEPARTMENT , although conceptually it belongs to MANAGES . This is because MANAGES  is a 1:1 relationship, so every department or employee entity participates in at most one relationship instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, the value of the Start_date  attribute can be determined separately, either by the participating department entity or by the participating employee (manager) entity. For a 1:N relationship type, a relationship attribute can be migrated only  to the entity type on the N-side of the relationship. For example, in Figure 3.9, if the WORKS_FOR  relationship also has an attribute Start_date  that indicates when an employee started working for a department, this attribute can be included as an attribute of EMPLOYEE .\n",
      "\n",
      "This is because each employee works for at most one department, and hence participates in at most one relationship instance in WORKS_FOR, but a department can have many employees, each with a different start date . In both 1:1 and 1:N relationship types, the decision where to place a relationship attribute—as a relationship type attribute or as an attribute of a participating entity type—is determined subjectively by the schema designer.\n",
      "\n",
      "For M:N (many-to-many) relationship types, some attributes may be determined by the combination of participating entities  in a relationship instance, not by any single entity. Such attributes must be specified as relationship attributes . An example is the Hours  attribute of the M:N relationship WORKS_ON  (Figure 3.13); the  number of hours per week an employee currently works on a project is determined by an employee-project combination and not separately by either entity. 3.5 Weak Entity Types  79\n",
      "\n",
      "3.5 Weak Entity Types   Entity types that do not have key attributes of their own are called weak entity types . In contrast, regular entity types  that do have a key attribute—which include all the exam- ples discussed so far—are called strong entity types . Entities belonging to a weak entity type are identified by being related to specific entities from another entity type in com-bination with one of their attribute values.\n",
      "\n",
      "We call this other entity type the identifying or owner entity type , 10 and we call the relationship type that relates a weak entity type to its owner the identifying relationship  of the weak entity type.11 A weak entity type always has a total participation constraint  (existence dependency) with respect to its identifying relationship because a weak entity cannot be identified without an owner entity. However, not every existence dependency results in a weak entity type.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, a DRIVER_LICENSE  entity cannot exist unless it is related to a PERSON  entity, even though it has its own key (License_number)  and hence is not a weak entity. Consider the entity type DEPENDENT , related to EMPLOYEE , which is used to keep track of the dependents of each employee via a 1:N relationship (Figure 3.2).\n",
      "\n",
      "In our example, the attributes of DEPENDENT  are Name  (the first name of the dependent), Birth_date , Sex, and Relationship  (to the employee). Two dependents of two distinct employees  may, by chance, have the same values for Name , Birth_date , Sex, and Relationship , but they are still distinct entities. They are identified as distinct entities only after determining the particular employee entity  to which each dependent is related. Each employee entity is said to own the dependent entities that are related to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "A weak entity type normally has a partial key , which is the attribute that can uniquely identify weak entities that are related to the same owner entity .12 In our example, if we assume that no two dependents of the same employee ever have the same first name, the attribute  Name of DEPENDENT  is the partial key. In the worst case, a composite attribute of all the weak entity’s attributes  will be the partial key.\n",
      "\n",
      "In ER diagrams, both a weak entity type and its identifying relationship are distin- guished by surrounding their boxes and diamonds with double lines (see Fig-ure 3.2). The partial key attribute is underlined with a dashed or dotted line. Weak entity types can sometimes be represented as complex (composite, multival- ued) attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the preceding example, we could specify a multivalued attribute Dependents  for EMPLOYEE , which is a multivalued composite attribute with the component attributes Name , Birth_date , Sex, and Relationship . The choice of which representation to use is made by the database designer. One criterion that may be used is to choose the weak entity type representation if the weak entity type partici-pates independently in relationship types other than its identifying relationship type.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, any number of levels of weak entity types can be defined; an owner entity type may itself be a weak entity type. In addition, a weak entity type may have more than one identifying entity type and an identifying relationship type of degree higher than two, as we illustrate in Section 3.9. 10The identifying entity type is also sometimes called the parent entity type  or the dominant entity type . 11The weak entity type is also sometimes called the child entity type  or the subordinate entity type .\n",

      "\n",
      "3.6  Refining the ER Design for   the CO MPANY Database We can now refine the database design in Figure 3.8 by changing the attributes that represent relationships into relationship types. The cardinality ratio and participa-tion constraint of each relationship type are determined from the requirements listed in Section 3.2. If some cardinality ratio or dependency cannot be determined from the requirements, the users must be questioned further to determine these structural constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our example, we specify the following relationship types: ■ MANAGES , which is a 1:1(one-to-one) relationship type between EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT . EMPLOYEE  participation is partial. DEPARTMENT participation is not clear from the requirements. We question the users, who say that a department must have a manager at all times, which implies total participation. 13 The attribute Start_date  is assigned to this relationship type.\n",
      "\n",
      "■ WORKS_FOR , a 1:N (one-to-many) relationship type between DEPARTMENT  and EMPLOYEE . Both participations are total. ■ CONTROLS , a 1:N relationship type between DEPARTMENT  and PROJECT . The participation of PROJECT  is total, whereas that of DEPARTMENT  is deter- mined to be partial, after consultation with the users indicates that some departments may control no projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "■ SUPERVISION , a 1:N relationship type between EMPLOYEE  (in the supervi- sor role) and EMPLOYEE  (in the supervisee role). Both participations are determined to be partial, after the users indicate that not every employee is a supervisor and not every employee has a supervisor. ■ WORKS_ON , determined to be an M:N (many-to-many) relationship type with attribute Hours , after the users indicate that a project can have several employees working on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both participations are determined to be total. ■ DEPENDENTS_OF , a 1:N relationship type between EMPLOYEE  and DEPENDENT , which is also the identifying relationship for the weak entity type DEPENDENT . The participation of EMPLOYEE  is partial, whereas that of DEPENDENT  is total. After specifying the previous six relationship types, we remove from the entity types in Figure 3.8 all attributes that have been refined into relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "These include Manager and Manager_start_date  from DEPARTMENT ; Controlling_department  from PROJECT ; Department , Supervisor , and Works_on  from EMPLOYEE ; and Employee  from DEPENDENT . It is important to have the least possible redundancy when we design the conceptual schema of a database. If some redundancy is desired at the storage level or at the user view level, it can be introduced later, as discussed in Section 1.6.1.\n",
      "\n",
      "13The rules in the miniworld that determine the constraints are sometimes called the business rules , since they are determined by the business  or organization that will utilize the database. 3.7 ER Diagrams, Naming Conventions, and Design Issues  81\n",
      "\n",
      "3.7.1 Summary of Notation for ER Diagrams Figures 3.9 through 3.13 illustrate examples of the participation of entity types in relationship types by displaying their entity sets and relationship sets (or  extensions)—the individual entity instances in an entity set and the individual rela-tionship instances in a relationship set. In ER diagrams the emphasis is on repre-senting the schemas rather than the instances. This is more useful in database design because a database schema changes rarely, whereas the contents of the entity sets may change frequently.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the schema is obviously easier to display, because it is much smaller. Figure 3.2 displays the COMPANY  ER database schema  as an ER diagram . We now review the full ER diagram notation. Regular (strong) entity types such as EMPLOYEE , DEPARTMENT , and PROJECT  are shown in rectangular boxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relation- ship types such as WORKS_FOR , MANAGES , CONTROLS , and WORKS_ON  are shown in diamond-shaped boxes attached to the participating entity types with straight lines. Attributes are shown in ovals, and each attribute is attached by a straight line to its entity type or relationship type. Component attributes of a composite attri-bute are attached to the oval representing the composite attribute, as illustrated by the Name  attribute of EMPLOYEE .\n",
      "\n",
      "Multivalued attributes are shown in double ovals, as illustrated by the Locations  attribute of DEPARTMENT . Key attributes have their names underlined. Derived attributes are shown in dotted ovals, as illustrated by the Number_of_employees  attribute of DEPARTMENT . Weak entity types are distinguished by being placed in double rectangles and by having their identifying relationship placed in double diamonds, as illustrated by the DEPENDENT  entity type and the DEPENDENTS_OF  identifying relationship type.\n",
      "\n",
      "The partial key of the weak entity type is underlined with a dotted line. In Figure 3.2 the cardinality ratio of each binary  relationship type is specified by attaching a 1, M, or N on each participating edge. The cardinality ratio  of DEPARTMENT:EMPLOYEE  in MANAGES  is 1:1, whereas it is 1:N for DEPARTMENT: EMPLOYEE  in WORKS_FOR , and M:N for WORKS_ON .\n",
      "\n",
      "The partici- pation constraint is specified by a single line for partial participation and by double lines for total participation (existence dependency). In Figure 3.2 we show the role names for the SUPERVISION  relationship type because the same EMPLOYEE  entity type plays two distinct roles in that relation- ship. Notice that the cardinality ratio is 1:N from supervisor to supervisee because each employee in the role of supervisee has at most one direct supervisor, whereas an employee in the role of supervisor can supervise zero or more employees.\n",

      "Figure 3.14 summarizes the conventions for ER diagrams. It is important to note that there are many other alternative diagrammatic notations (see Section 3.7.4 and Appendix Figure 3.14: Rectangle - Entity Double rectangle - Weak entity Diamond - relationship Double diamond - identifying relationship Oval - attribute Oval with underlying line - key attribute Dashed oval - derived attribute\n",
      "\n",
      "3.7.2 Proper Naming of Schema Constructs When designing a database schema, the choice of names for entity types, attributes, relationship types, and (particularly) roles is not always straightforward. One should choose names that convey, as much as possible, the meanings attached to the different constructs in the schema. We choose to use singular names  for entity types, rather than plural ones, because the entity type name applies to each indi-vidual entity belonging to that entity type.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our ER diagrams, we will use the con-vention that entity type and relationship type names are in uppercase letters, attribute names have their initial letter capitalized, and role names are in lowercase letters. We have used this convention in Figure 3.2. As a general practice, given a narrative description of the database requirements, the nouns  appearing in the narrative tend to give rise to entity type names, and the verbs  tend to indicate names of relationship types. Attribute names generally arise from additional nouns that describe the nouns corresponding to entity types.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another naming consideration involves choosing binary relationship names to make the ER diagram of the schema readable from left to right and from top to bot-tom. We have generally followed this guideline in Figure 3.2. To explain this nam-ing convention further, we have one exception to the convention in Figure 3.2—the DEPENDENTS_OF  relationship type, which reads from bottom to top.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we describe this relationship, we can say that the DEPENDENT  entities (bottom entity type) are DEPENDENTS_OF  (relationship name) an EMPLOYEE  (top entity type). To change this to read from top to bottom, we could rename the relationship type to HAS_DEPENDENTS , which would then read as follows: An EMPLOYEE  entity (top entity type) HAS_DEPENDENTS  (relationship name) of type DEPENDENT  (bottom entity type).\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that this issue arises because each binary relationship can be described starting from either of the two participating entity types, as discussed in the beginning of Section 3.4.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.7.3 Design Choices for ER Conceptual Design It is occasionally difficult to decide whether a particular concept in the miniworld should be modeled as an entity type, an attribute, or a relationship type. In this  section, we give some brief guidelines as to which construct should be chosen in particular situations. In general, the schema design process should be considered an iterative refinement process, where an initial design is created and then iteratively refined until the most suitable design is reached.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the refinements that are often used include the following: ■ A concept may be first modeled as an attribute and then refined into a rela- tionship because it is determined that the attribute is a reference to another entity type. It is often the case that a pair of such attributes that are inverses of one another are refined into a binary relationship. We discussed this type of refinement in detail in Section 3.6.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that in our  notation, once an attribute is replaced by a relationship, the attribute itself should be removed from the entity type to avoid duplication and redundancy. ■ Similarly, an attribute that exists in several entity types may be elevated or promoted to an independent entity type.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, suppose that each of several entity types in a UNIVERSITY  database, such as STUDENT , INSTRUCTOR , and COURSE , has an attribute Department in the initial design; the designer may then choose to create an entity type DEPARTMENT  with a single attribute Dept_name  and relate it to the three entity types ( STUDENT , INSTRUCTOR , and COURSE ) via appropriate rela- tionships. Other attributes/relationships of DEPARTMENT  may be discov- ered later.\n",
      "\n",
      "■ An inverse refinement to the previous case may be applied—for example, if an entity type DEPARTMENT  exists in the initial design with a single attribute Dept_name  and is related to only one other entity type, STUDENT . In this case, DEPARTMENT  may be reduced or demoted to an attribute of STUDENT . ■ Section 3.9 discusses choices concerning the degree of a relationship. In Chap- ter 4, we discuss other refinements concerning specialization/generalization.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.7.4 Alternative Notations for ER Diagrams There are many alternative diagrammatic notations for displaying ER diagrams. Appendix A gives some of the more popular notations. In Section 3.8, we introduce the Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation for class diagrams, which has been proposed as a standard for conceptual object modeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this section, we describe one alternative ER notation for specifying structural constraints on relationships, which replaces the cardinality ratio (1:1, 1:N, M:N) and single/double-line notation for participation constraints. This notation involves associating a pair of integer numbers (min, max) with each participation of an entity type E in a relationship type R, where 0 ≤ min ≤ max and max ≥ 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "The numbers mean that for each entity e in E, e must participate in at least min and at most max  relationship instances in R at any point in time . In this method, min = 0 implies partial participation, whereas min > 0 implies total participation. Figure 3.15 displays the COMPANY  database schema using the (min, max) nota- tion.14 Usually, one uses either the cardinality ratio/single-line/double-line nota- tion or the (min, max) notation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The (min, max) notation is more precise, and we can use it to specify some structural constraints for relationship types of higher degree . However, it is not sufficient for specifying some key constraints on higher- degree relationships, as discussed in Section 3.9. Figure 3.15 also displays all the role names for the COMPANY database schema. 14In some notations, particularly those used in object modeling methodologies such as UML, the (min, max) is placed on the opposite sides  to the ones we have shown.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, for the WORKS_FOR relationship in Figure 3.15, the (1,1) would be on the DEPARTMENT  side, and the (4,N) would be on the EMPLOYEE  side. Here we used the original notation from Abrial (1974). 3.8 Example of Other Notation: UML Class Diagrams  85\n",

      "\n",
      "In UML class diagrams, a class  (similar to an entity type in ER) is displayed as a box (see Figure 3.16) that includes three sections: The top section gives the class name (similar to entity type name); the middle section includes the attributes ; and the last section includes operations  that can be applied to individual objects (similar to individual entities in an entity set) of the class. Operations are not specified in ER diagrams. Consider the EMPLOYEE  class in Figure 3.16.\n",

The designer can optionally specify the domain  (or data type) of an attribute if desired, by placing a colon (:) followed by the domain name or description, as illustrated by the Name , Sex, and Bdate  attributes of EMPLOYEE  in Figure 3.16.

      "\n",
      "The (min, max) notation described in Section 3.7.4 is used to specify relationship constraints, which are called multiplicities  in UML terminology. Multiplicities are specified in the form min..max , and an asterisk (*) indicates no maximum limit on participation. How- ever, the multiplicities are placed on the opposite ends of the relationship  when com- pared with the (min, max) notation discussed in Section 3.7.4 (compare Fig - ures 3.15 and 3.16).\n",
      "\n",
      "In UML, a single asterisk indicates a multiplicity of 0 ..*, and a single 1 indicates a multiplicity of 1..1. A recursive relationship type (see Section 3.4.2) is called a reflexive association  in UML, and the role names—like the multiplicities— are placed at the opposite ends of an association when compared with the placing of role names in Figure 3.15. In UML, there are two types of relationships: association and aggregation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aggregation  is meant to represent a relationship between a whole object and its com- ponent parts, and it has a distinct diagrammatic notation. In Figure 3.16, we modeled the locations of a department and the single location of a project as aggregations. However, aggregation and association do not have different structural properties, and the choice as to which type of relationship to use—aggregation or association—is somewhat subjective. In the ER model, both are represented as relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "UML also distinguishes between unidirectional  and bidirectional  associations (or aggregations). In the unidirectional case, the line connecting the classes is dis-played with an arrow to indicate that only one direction for accessing related objects is needed. If no arrow is displayed, the bidirectional case is assumed, which is the default.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if we always expect to access the manager of a depart-ment starting from a DEPARTMENT  object, we would draw the association line rep- resenting the MANAGES  association with an arrow from DEPARTMENT  to EMPLOYEE . In addition, relationship instances may be specified to be ordered . For example, we could specify that the employee objects related to each depart- ment through the WORKS_FOR  association (relationship) should be ordered by their Start_date  attribute value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Association (relationship) names are optional  in UML, and relationship attributes are displayed in a box attached with a dashed line to the line representing the association/aggregation (see Start_date  and Hours in Figure 3.16). The operations given in each class are derived from the functional requirements of the application, as we discussed in Section 3.1. It is generally sufficient to specify the operation names initially for the logical operations that are expected to be applied to individual objects of a class, as shown in Figure 3.16.\n",

      "Recall that the relationship set of SUPPLY  is a set of rela- tionship instances ( s, j, p), where the meaning is that s is a SUPPLIER  who is currently supplying a PART  p to a PROJECT  j. In general, a relationship type R of degree n will have n edges in an ER diagram, one connecting R to each participating entity type.

Hence, an entity in the weak entity type SUPPLY  in Figure 3.17(c) is identified by the combination of its three owner entities from SUPPLIER , PART , and PROJECT . It is also possible to represent the ternary relationship as a regular entity type by introducing an artificial or surrogate key.\n",

We started by discussing the role that a high-level data model plays in the database design process, and then we presented a sample set of database requirements for the COMPANY  database, which is one of the  3.11 Summary  95 examples that is used throughout this text. We defined the basic ER model  concepts of entities and their attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we discussed NULL  values and presented the various types of attributes, which can be nested arbitrarily to produce complex attributes: ■ Simple or atomic ■ Composite ■ Multivalued We also briefly discussed stored versus derived attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we discussed the ER model concepts at the schema or “intension” level: ■ Entity types and their corresponding entity sets ■ Key attributes of entity types ■ Value sets (domains) of attributes ■ Relationship types and their corresponding relationship sets ■ Participation roles of entity types in relationship types We presented two methods for specifying the structural constraints on relationship types.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first method distinguished two types of structural constraints: ■ Cardinality ratios (1:1, 1:N, M:N for binary relationships) ■ Participation constraints (total, partial) We noted that, alternatively, another method of specifying structural constraints is to specify minimum and maximum numbers (min, max) on the participation of each entity type in a relationship type. We discussed weak entity types and the related concepts of owner entity types, identifying relationship types and partial key attributes. Entity–relationship schemas can be represented diagrammatically as ER diagrams.\n",
      "\n",
      "We showed how to design an ER schema for the COMPANY  database by first defin- ing the entity types and their attributes and then refining the design to include rela- tionship types. We displayed the ER diagram for the COMPANY  database schema. We discussed some of the basic concepts of UML class diagrams and how they relate to ER modeling concepts. We also described ternary and higher-degree relationship types in more detail, and we discussed the circumstances under which they are distinguished from binary relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we presented require-ments for a UNIVERSITY database schema as another example, and we showed the ER schema design. The ER modeling concepts we have presented thus far—entity types, relationship types, attributes, keys, and structural constraints—can model many database appli-cations. However, more complex applications—such as engineering design, medi-cal information systems, and telecommunications—require additional concepts if we want to model them with greater accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We discuss some advanced model-ing concepts in Chapter 8 and revisit further advanced data modeling techniques in Chapter 26.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ER modeling concepts discussed in Chapter 3 are sufficient for representing many database sche- mas for traditional  database applications, which include many data-processing applications in business and industry. Since the late 1970s, however, designers of database applications have tried to design more accurate database schemas that reflect the data properties and constraints more precisely.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was particularly important for newer applications of database technology, such as databases for engineering design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM), 1 telecommunications, com- plex software systems, and geographic information systems (GISs), among many other applications. These types of databases have requirements that are more com-plex than the more traditional applications. This led to the development of addi-tional semantic data modeling  concepts that were incorporated into conceptual data models such as the ER model. Various semantic data models have been pro-posed in the literature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of these concepts were also developed independently in related areas of computer science, such as the knowledge representation  area of artificial intelligence and the object modeling  area in software engineering. In this chapter, we describe features that have been proposed for semantic data models and show how the ER model can be enhanced to include these concepts, which leads to the enhanced ER (EER ) model. 2 We start in Section 4.1 by incorpo- rating the concepts of class/subclass relationships  and type inheritance  into the ER model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, in Section 4.2, we add the concepts of specialization  and generalization. Section 4.3 discusses the various types of constraints  on specialization/generalization, and Section 4.4 shows how the UNION  construct can be modeled by including the chapter 4 1CAD/CAM stands for computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing.\n",

      "For a detailed introduction to conceptual modeling, Chapter 4 should be consid- ered a continuation of Chapter 3.

      "\n",
      "4.1 Subclasses, Superclasses, and Inheritance   The EER model includes all the modeling concepts of the ER model  that were pre- sented in Chapter 3. In addition, it includes the concepts of subclass  and superclass and the related concepts of specialization  and generalization  (see Sections 4.2 and 4.3).\n",
      "\n",
      "Another concept included in the EER model is that of a category  or union type  (see Section 4.4), which is used to represent a collection of objects (entities) that is the union  of objects of different entity types. Associated with these concepts is the important mechanism of attribute and relationship inheritance . Unfortu- nately, no standard terminology exists for these concepts, so we use the most com- mon terminology. Alternative terminology is given in footnotes. We also describe a diagrammatic technique for displaying these concepts when they arise in an EER schema.\n",
      "\n",
      "We call the resulting schema diagrams enhanced ER  or EER diagrams . The first enhanced ER (EER) model concept we take up is that of a subtype  or subclass  of an entity type. As we discussed in Chapter 3, the name of an entity type is used to represent both a type of entity  and the entity set  or collection of entities of that type that exist in the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the entity type EMPLOYEE  describes the type (that is, the attributes and relationships) of each employee entity, and also refers to the current set of EMPLOYEE  entities in the COMPANY  database. In many cases an entity type has numerous subgroupings or subtypes of its entities that are meaningful and need to be represented explicitly because of their significance to the database application.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the entities that are members of the EMPLOYEE  entity type may be distinguished further into SECRETARY , ENGINEER , MANAGER , TECHNICIAN , SALARIED_EMPLOYEE , HOURLY_EMPLOYEE , and so on. The set or collection of entities in each of the latter groupings is a subset of the entities that belong to the EMPLOYEE  entity set, meaning that every entity that is a member of one of these subgroupings is also an employee.\n",
      "\n",
      "We call each of these subgroupings a  4.1 Subclasses, Superclasses, and Inheritance  109 subclass  or subtype  of the EMPLOYEE  entity type, and the EMPLOYEE  entity type is called the superclass  or supertype  for each of these subclasses. Figure 4.1 shows how to represent these concepts diagramatically in EER diagrams. (The circle notation in Figure 4.1 will be explained in Section 4.2.)\n",
      "\n",
      "We call the relationship between a superclass and any one of its subclasses a superclass/subclass  or supertype/subtype  or simply class/subclass relationship . 3 In our previous example, EMPLOYEE/SECRETARY  and EMPLOYEE/TECHNICIAN are two class/subclass relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that a member entity of the subclass repre sents the same real-world entity  as some member of the superclass; for example, a SECRETARY  entity ‘Joan Logano’ is also the EMPLOYEE  ‘Joan Logano.’ Hence, the subclass member is the same as the entity in the superclass, but in a distinct specific role.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we implement a superclass/subclass relationship in the database system, however, we may represent a member of the subclass as a distinct database object—say, a distinct record that is related via the key attribute to its superclass entity. In Section 9.2, we discuss various options for representing superclass/subclass relationships in relational databases. An entity cannot exist in the database merely by being a member of a subclass; it must also be a member of the superclass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such an entity can be included optionally 3A class/subclass relationship is often called an IS-A (or IS-AN ) relationship  because of the way we refer to the concept. We say a SECRETARY is an EMPLOYEE, a TECHNICIAN is an EMPLOYEE, and so on. For example, a salaried employee who is also an engineer belongs to the two subclasses ENGINEER  and SALARIED_EMPLOYEE of the EMPLOYEE  entity type.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is not necessary that every entity in a superclass is a member of some subclass. An important concept associated with subclasses (subtypes) is that of type inheritance . Recall that the type of an entity is defined by the attributes it possesses and the relationship types in which it participates. Because an entity in the subclass represents the same real-world entity from the superclass, it should possess values for its specific attributes as well as  values of its attributes as a member of the super- class.\n",
      "\n",
      "We say that an entity that is a member of a subclass inherits  all the attributes of the entity as a member of the superclass. The entity also inherits all the relationships in which the superclass participates. Notice that a subclass, with its own specific (or local) attributes and relationships together with all the attributes and relationships it inherits from the superclass, can be considered an entity type  in its own right. 4\n",
      "\n",
      "4.2.1 Specialization Specialization  is the process of defining a set of subclasses  of an entity type; this entity type is called the superclass  of the specialization. The set of subclasses that forms a specialization is defined on the basis of some distinguishing characteristic of the entities in the superclass.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the set of subclasses {SECRETARY, ENGINEER, TECHNICIAN}  is a specialization of the superclass EMPLOYEE  that dis- tinguishes among employee entities based on the job type  of each employee. We may have several specializations of the same entity type based on different distinguishing characteristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, another specialization of the EMPLOYEE  entity type may yield the set of subclasses {SALARIED_EMPLOYEE, HOURLY_EMPLOYEE} ; this specialization distinguishes among employees based on the method of pay. Figure 4.1 shows how we represent a specialization diagrammatically in an EER diagram. The subclasses that define a specialization are attached by lines to a circle that represents the specialization, which is connected in turn to the superclass.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subset symbol  on each line connecting a subclass to the circle indicates the direction of the superclass/subclass relationship. 5 Attributes that apply only to entities of a particular subclass—such as TypingSpeed  of SECRETARY —are attached to the rect- angle representing that subclass. These are called specific  (or local ) attributes  of the subclass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, a subclass can participate in specific relationship types , such as the HOURLY_EMPLOYEE  subclass participating in the BELONGS_TO 4In some object-oriented programming languages, a common restriction is that an entity (or object) has only one type . This is generally too restrictive for conceptual database modeling. 5There are many alternative notations for specialization; we present the UML notation in Section 4.6 and other proposed notations in Appendix A.\n",

      "4.2 Specialization and Generalization  111 relationship in Figure 4.1. We will explain the d symbol in the circles in Figure 4.1 and additional EER diagram notation shortly. Figure 4.2 shows a few entity instances that belong to subclasses of the {SECRETARY, ENGINEER, TECHNICIAN}  specialization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, notice that an entity that belongs to a subclass represents the same real-world entity  as the entity connected to it in the EMPLOYEE  superclass, even though the same entity is shown twice; for example, e1 is shown in both EMPLOYEE  and SECRETARY  in Figure 4.2. As the figure suggests, a superclass/subclass relationship such as EMPLOYEE/SECRETARY  somewhat resembles a 1:1 relationship at the instance level  (see Figure 3.12).\n",
      "\n",
      "The main differ- ence is that in a 1:1 relationship two distinct entities  are related, whereas in a super- class/subclass relationship the entity in the subclass is the same real-world entity as the entity in the superclass but is playing a specialized role— for example, an EMPLOYEE  specialized in the role of SECRETARY , or an EMPLOYEE  specialized in the role of TECHNICIAN . There are two main reasons for including class/subclass relationships and special- izations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first is that certain attributes may apply to some but not all entities of the superclass entity type. A subclass is defined in order to group the entities to which these attributes apply. The members of the subclass may still share the majority of their attributes with the other members of the superclass.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in Figure 4.1 the SECRETARY  subclass has the specific attribute Typing_speed , whereas the ENGINEER  subclass has the specific attribute Eng_type , but SECRETARY  and ENGINEER  share their other inherited attributes from the EMPLOYEE  entity type. The second reason for using subclasses is that some relationship types may be par- ticipated in only by entities that are members of the subclass.\n",

A diagrammatic notation to distinguish between generalization and specialization is used in some design methodologies. An arrow pointing to the generalized super-class represents a generalization process, whereas arrows pointing to the special-ized subclasses represent a specialization process.\n",

      "We will not use this notation because the decision as to which process was followed in a particular situation is often subjective. So far we have introduced the concepts of subclasses and superclass/subclass rela- tionships, as well as the specialization and generalization processes. In general, a superclass or subclass represents a collection of entities of the same type and hence also describes an entity type ; that is why superclasses and subclasses are all shown in rectangles in EER diagrams, like entity types.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.3  Constraints and Characteristics   of Specialization and Generalization Hierarchies First, we discuss constraints that apply to a single specialization or a single general- ization. For brevity, our discussion refers only to specialization  even though it applies to both  specialization and generalization. Then, we discuss differences between specialization/generalization lattices  (multiple inheritance ) and hierarchies (single inheritance ), and we elaborate on the differences between the specialization and generalization processes during conceptual database schema design.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.3.1 Constraints on Specialization and Generalization In general, we may have several specializations defined on the same entity type (or superclass), as shown in Figure 4.1. In such a case, entities may belong to subclasses in each of the specializations. A specialization may also consist of a single  subclass only, such as the {MANAGER}  specialization in Figure 4.1; in such a case, we do not use the circle notation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some specializations we can determine exactly the entities that will become members of each subclass by placing a condition on the value of some attribute of the superclass. Such subclasses are called predicate-defined  (or condition-defined ) subclasses . For example, if the EMPLOYEE  entity type has an attribute Job_type , as shown in Figure 4.4, we can specify the condition of membership in the SECRETARY  subclass by the condition ( Job_type  = ‘Secretary’), which we call the defining predicate  of the subclass.\n",
      "\n",
      "This condition is a constraint  specifying that exactly those entities of the EMPLOYEE  entity type whose attribute value for Job_type  114 Chapter 4 The Enhanced Entity–Relationship (EER) Model is ‘Secretary’ belong to the subclass. We display a predicate-defined subclass by writing the predicate condition next to the line that connects the subclass to the specialization circle.\n",
      "\n",
      "If all subclasses in a specialization have their membership condition on the same attribute of the superclass, the specialization itself is called an attribute-defined specialization , and the attribute is called the defining attribute  of the special- ization. 6 In this case, all the entities with the same value for the attribute belong to the same subclass. We display an attribute-defined specialization by placing the defining attribute name next to the arc from the circle to the superclass, as shown in Figure 4.4.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we do not have a condition for determining membership in a subclass, the subclass is called user-defined . Membership in such a subclass is determined by the database users when they apply the operation to add an entity to the subclass; hence, membership is specified individually for each entity by the user , not by any condi- tion that may be evaluated automatically. Two other constraints may apply to a specialization. The first is the disjointness constraint , which specifies that the subclasses of the specialization must be disjoint sets.\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that an entity can be a member of at most  one of the subclasses of the specialization. A specialization that is attribute-defined implies the disjointness constraint (if the attribute used to define the membership predicate is single- valued). Figure 4.4 illustrates this case, where the d in the circle stands for disjoint .\n",

This case, which is the default, is displayed by placing an o in the circle, as shown in Figure 4.5. The second constraint on specialization is called the completeness  (or totalness ) constraint , which may be total or partial.\n",
      "\n",
      "A total specialization  constraint specifies that every  entity in the superclass must be a member of at least one subclass in the specialization. For example, if every EMPLOYEE  must be either an HOURLY_EMPLOYEE  or a SALARIED_EMPLOYEE , then the specialization {HOURLY_EMPLOYEE, SALARIED_EMPLOYEE}  in Figure 4.1 is a total specialization of EMPLOYEE.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is shown in EER diagrams by using a double line to connect the superclass to the circle. A single line is used to display a partial specialization , which allows an entity not to belong to any of the subclasses. For example, if some EMPLOYEE  entities do not belong to any of the subclasses {SECRETARY, ENGINEER, TECHNICIAN}  in Figures 4.1 and 4.4, then that specialization is partial.7 Notice that the disjointness and completeness constraints are independent.\n",

      "Hence, we have the following four possible constraints on a specialization: ■Disjoint, total ■Disjoint, partial ■Overlapping, total ■Overlapping, partial Of course, the correct constraint is determined from the real-world meaning that applies to each specialization. In general, a superclass that was identified through the generalization  process usually is total , because the superclass is derived from  the subclasses and hence contains only the entities that are in the subclasses.\n",
      "\n",

Each person has a name, SSN, sex, address, and birth date. 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every employee has a salary, and there are three types of employees: fac-ulty, staff, and student assistants. Each employee belongs to exactly one of these types. For each alumnus, a record of the degree or degrees that he or she earned at the university is kept, including the name of the degree, the year granted, and the major department. Each student has a major department. 3. Each faculty has a rank, whereas each staff member has a staff position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stu-dent assistants are classified further as either research assistants or teaching assistants, and the percent of time that they work is recorded in the database. Research assistants have their research project stored, whereas teaching assistants have the current course they work on.

      "In Figure 4.7, all person entities represented in the database are members of the PERSON  entity type, which is specialized into the subclasses {EMPLOYEE, ALUMNUS, STUDENT} . This specialization is overlapping; for example, an alum- nus may also be an employee and a student pursuing an advanced degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subclass STUDENT  is the superclass for the specialization {GRADUATE_STUDENT, UNDERGRADUATE_STUDENT} , whereas EMPLOYEE is the superclass for the specialization {STUDENT_ASSISTANT, FACULTY, STAFF} . Notice that STUDENT_ASSISTANT  is also a subclass of STUDENT .\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, STUDENT_ASSISTANT is the superclass for the specialization into {RESEARCH_ASSISTANT, TEACHING_ASSISTANT} . In such a specialization lattice or hierarchy, a subclass inherits the attributes not only of its direct superclass, but also of all its predecessor superclasses all the way to the root  of the hierarchy or lattice if necessary. For example, an entity in GRADUATE_STUDENT  inherits all the attributes of that entity as a STUDENT  and as a PERSON .\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that an entity may exist in several leaf nodes  of the hierarchy, where a leaf node  is a class that has no subclasses of its own. For example, a member of GRADUATE_STUDENT  may also be a member of RESEARCH_ASSISTANT . A subclass with more than one  superclass is called a shared subclass , such as ENGINEERING_MANAGER  in Figure 4.6.\n",
      "\n",
      "This leads to the concept known as multiple inheritance , where the shared subclass ENGINEERING_MANAGER directly inherits attributes and relationships from multiple superclasses. Notice that the existence of at least one shared subclass leads to a lattice (and hence to multiple inheritance ); if no shared subclasses existed, we would have a hierarchy rather than a lattice and only single inheritance  would exist.\n",

      "It is important to note here that some models and languages are limited to single inheritance  and do not allow  multiple inheritance (shared subclasses). It is also important to note that some models do not allow an entity to have multiple types, and hence an entity can be a member of only one leaf class.8 In such a model, it is necessary to create additional subclasses as leaf nodes to cover all 8In some models, the class is further restricted to be a leaf node  in the hierarchy or lattice.\n",

Obviously, this can lead to extra complexity.\n",

      "4.3.3  Utilizing Specialization and Generalization in Refining Conceptual Schemas Now we elaborate on the differences between the specialization and generalization processes and how they are used to refine conceptual schemas during conceptual database design. In the specialization process, the database designers typically start with an entity type and then define subclasses of the entity type by successive spe-cialization; that is, they repeatedly define more specific groupings of the entity type.\n",

      "For example, when designing the specialization lattice in Figure 4.7, we may first specify an entity type PERSON  for a university database. Then we discover that three types of persons will be represented in the database: university employ- ees, alumni, and students and we create the specialization {EMPLOYEE, ALUMNUS, STUDENT} . The overlapping constraint is chosen because a person may belong to more than one of the subclasses.\n",
      "\n",
      "We specialize EMPLOYEE  further into {STAFF, FACULTY, STUDENT_ASSISTANT} , and specialize STUDENT  into {GRADUATE_ STUDENT, UNDERGRADUATE_STUDENT} . Finally, we specialize STUDENT_ASSISTANT  into {RESEARCH_ASSISTANT, TEACHING_ASSISTANT} . This process is called top-down conceptual refinement .\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, we have a hier- archy; then we realize that STUDENT_ASSISTANT  is a shared subclass, since it is also a subclass of STUDENT , leading to the lattice. It is possible to arrive at the same hierarchy or lattice from the other direction. In such a case, the process involves generalization rather than specialization and cor-responds to a bottom-up conceptual synthesis .\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the database design- ers may first discover entity types such as STAFF , FACULTY , ALUMNUS , GRADUATE_STUDENT , UNDERGRADUATE_STUDENT , RESEARCH_ASSISTANT , TEACHING_ASSISTANT , and so on; then they generalize {GRADUATE_STUDENT, UNDERGRADUATE_STUDENT}  into STUDENT ; then {RESEARCH_ASSISTANT, TEACHING_ASSISTANT}  into STUDENT_ASSISTANT ; then {STAFF, FACULTY, STUDENT_ASSISTANT}  into EMPLOYEE ; and finally {EMPLOYEE, ALUMNUS, STUDENT} into PERSON .\n",
      "\n",
      "The final design of hierarchies or lattices resulting from either process may be identical; the only difference relates to the manner or order in which the schema superclasses and subclasses were created during the design process. In practice, it is likely that a combination of the two processes is employed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that the 120 Chapter 4 The Enhanced Entity–Relationship (EER) Model notion of representing data and knowledge by using superclass/subclass hierar- chies and lattices is quite common in knowledge-based systems and expert sys-tems, which combine database technology with artificial intelligence techniques.

Specialization is also common in software engineering design methodologies that are based on the object-oriented paradigm.\n",

      "4.4 Modeling of U NION Types Using Categories It is sometimes necessary to represent a collection of entities from different entity types. In this case, a subclass will represent a collection of entities that is a subset of the UNION  of entities from distinct entity types; we call such a subclass  a union type or a category .9 For example, suppose that we have three entity types: PERSON , BANK , and COMPANY .\n",

A category (union type) OWNER  that is a subclass of the UNION  of the three entity sets of COMPANY , BANK , and PERSON  can be created for this purpose. We display categories in an EER diagram as shown in Figure 4.8.\n",

However, the drawback is that the design becomes quite cluttered. It is important to represent only those subclasses that are deemed necessary to avoid extreme cluttering of the conceptual schema. ■If a subclass has few specific (local) attributes and no specific relationships, it can be merged into the superclass.\n",

      "For such a superclass/subclass relationship, we must always have S ⊆ C A specialization  Z = {S 1, S2, … , Sn} is a set of subclasses that have the same super- class G; that is, G/Si is a superclass/subclass relationship for i = 1, 2, … , n. G is called a generalized entity type  (or the superclass  of the specialization, or a generalization of the subclasses { S1, S2, … , Sn} ).\n",

      "\n",
      "A subclass S of C is said to be predicate-defined  if a predicate p on the attributes of C is used to specify which entities in C are members of S; that is, S = C[p], where C[p] is the set of entities in C that satisfy p. A subclass that is not defined by a predicate is called user-defined .\n",
      "\n",
      "A specialization Z (or generalization G) is said to be attribute-defined  if a predicate ( A = ci), where A is an attribute of G and ci is a constant value from the domain of A, is used to specify membership in each subclass Si in Z. Notice that if ci ≠ cj for i ≠ j, and A is a single-valued attribute, then the specialization will be disjoint.\n",

      "4.7  Data Abstraction, Knowledge   Representation, and Ontology Concepts In this section, we discuss in general terms some of the modeling concepts that we described quite specifically in our presentation of the ER and EER models in Chap- ter 3 and earlier in this chapter. This terminology is not only used in conceptual  4.7 Data Abstraction, Knowledge Representation, and Ontology Concepts  129 data modeling but also in artificial intelligence literature when discussing knowledge representation  (KR).\n",
      "\n",
      "This section discusses the similarities and differ- ences between conceptual modeling and knowledge representation, and introduces some of the alternative terminology and a few additional concepts. The goal of KR techniques is to develop concepts for accurately modeling some domain of knowledge  by creating an ontology 12 that describes the concepts of the domain and how these concepts are interrelated. The ontology is used to store and manipu-late knowledge for drawing inferences, making decisions, or answering questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goals of KR are similar to those of semantic data models, but there are some important similarities and differences between the two disciplines: ■Both disciplines use an abstraction process to identify common properties and important aspects of objects in the miniworld (also known as domain of discourse in KR) while suppressing insignificant differences and unimportant details. ■Both disciplines provide concepts, relationships, constraints, operations, and languages for defining data and representing knowledge. ■KR is generally broader in scope than semantic data models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Different forms of knowledge, such as rules (used in inference, deduction, and search), incomplete and default knowledge, and temporal and spatial knowledge, are represented in KR schemes. Database models are being expanded to include some of these concepts (see Chapter 26). ■KR schemes include reasoning mechanisms  that deduce additional facts from the facts stored in a database. Hence, whereas most current database systems are limited to answering direct queries, knowledge-based systems using KR schemes can answer queries that involve inferences  over the stored data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Database technology is being extended with inference mecha-nisms (see Section 26.5). ■Whereas most data models concentrate on the representation of database schemas, or meta-knowledge, KR schemes often mix up the schemas with the instances themselves in order to provide flexibility in representing exceptions. This often results in inefficiencies when these KR schemes are implemented, especially when compared with databases and when a large amount of structured data (facts) needs to be stored.\n",
      "\n",
      "We now discuss four abstraction concepts  that are used in semantic data models, such as the EER model, as well as in KR schemes: (1) classification and instantia-tion, (2) identification, (3) specialization and generalization, and (4) aggregation and association. The paired concepts of classification and instantiation are inverses of one another, as are generalization and specialization. The concepts of aggrega-tion and association are also related.\n",
      "\n",
      "We discuss these abstract concepts and their relation to the concrete representations used in the EER model to clarify the data abstraction process and to improve our understanding of the related process of conceptual schema design. We close the section with a brief discussion of ontology , which is being used widely in recent knowledge representation research. 12An ontology  is somewhat similar to a conceptual schema, but with more knowledge, rules, and exceptions.130 Chapter 4 The Enhanced Entity–Relationship (EER) Model\n",
      "\n",
      "4.7.1 Classification and Instantiation The process of classification  involves systematically assigning similar objects/enti- ties to object classes/entity types. We can now describe (in DB) or reason about (in KR) the classes rather than the individual objects. Collections of objects that share the same types of attributes, relationships, and constraints are classified into classes in order to simplify the process of discovering their properties. Instantiation  is the inverse of classification and refers to the generation and specific examination of distinct objects of a class.\n",
      "\n",
      "An object instance is related to its object class by the  IS-AN-INSTANCE-OF  or IS-A-MEMBER-OF  relationship. Although EER dia- grams do not display instances, the UML diagrams allow a form of instantiation by permitting the display of individual objects. We did not  describe this feature in our introduction to UML class diagrams. In general, the objects of a class should have a similar type structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, some objects may display properties that differ in some respects from the other objects of the class; these exception objects  also need to be modeled, and KR schemes allow more varied exceptions than do database models. In addition, cer-tain properties apply to the class as a whole and not to the individual objects; KR schemes allow such class properties . UML diagrams also allow specification of class properties. In the EER model, entities are classified into entity types according to their basic attributes and relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "Entities are further classified into subclasses and cat- egories based on additional similarities and differences (exceptions) among them. Relationship instances are classified into relationship types. Hence, entity types, subclasses, categories, and relationship types are the different concepts that are used for classification in the EER model. The EER model does not provide explicitly for class properties, but it may be extended to do so. In UML, objects are classified into classes, and it is possible to display both class properties and individual objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowledge representation models allow multiple classification schemes in which one class is an instance  of another class (called a meta-class ). Notice that this cannot  be represented directly in the EER model, because we have only two levels—classes and instances. The only relationship among classes in the EER model is a superclass/subclass relationship, whereas in some KR schemes an additional class/instance relationship can be represented directly in a class hierarchy. An instance may itself be another class, allowing multiple-level classification schemes.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.7.2 Identification Identification  is the abstraction process whereby classes and objects are made uniquely identifiable by means of some identifier . For example, a class name uniquely identifies a whole class within a schema. An additional mechanism is necessary for telling distinct object instances apart by means of object identifiers. Moreover, it is necessary to identify multiple manifestations in the database of the same real-world  4.7 Data Abstraction, Knowledge Representation, and Ontology Concepts  131 object.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we may have a tuple <‘Matthew Clarke’, ‘610618’, ‘376-9821’> in a PERSON  relation and another tuple <‘301-54-0836’, ‘CS’, 3.8> in a STUDENT  rela- tion that happen to represent the same real-world entity.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no way to identify the fact that these two database objects (tuples) represent the same real-world entity unless we make a provision at design time  for appropriate cross-referencing to supply this identification. Hence, identification is needed at two levels: ■To distinguish among database objects and classes ■To identify database objects and to relate them to their real-world counterparts In the EER model, identification of schema constructs is based on a system of unique names for the constructs in a schema.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, every class in an EER schema—whether it is an entity type, a subclass, a category, or a relationship type—must have a distinct name. The names of attributes of a particular class must also be distinct. Rules for unambiguously identifying attribute name references in a spe-cialization or generalization lattice or hierarchy are needed as well. At the object level, the values of key attributes are used to distinguish among enti- ties of a particular entity type.\n",
      "\n",
      "For weak entity types, entities are identified by a combination of their own partial key values and the entities they are related to in the owner entity type(s). Relationship instances are identified by some combination of the entities that they relate to, depending on the cardinality ratio specified.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.7.3 Specialization and Generalization Specialization  is the process of classifying a class of objects into more specialized subclasses. Generalization  is the inverse process of generalizing several classes into a higher-level abstract class that includes the objects in all these classes. Specializa-tion is conceptual refinement, whereas generalization is conceptual synthesis. Sub-classes are used in the EER model to represent specialization and generalization.\n",
      "\n",
      "We call the relationship between a subclass and its superclass an IS-A-SUBCLASS-OF relationship, or simply an IS-A  relationship. This is the same as the IS-A relation- ship discussed earlier in Section 4.5.3.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.7.4 Aggregation and Association Aggregation  is an abstraction concept for building composite objects from their component objects. There are three cases where this concept can be related to the EER model. The first case is the situation in which we aggregate attribute values of an object to form the whole object. The second case is when we represent an aggre-gation relationship as an ordinary relationship. The third case, which the EER model does not provide for explicitly, involves the possibility of combining objects that are related by a particular relationship instance into a higher-level aggregate object.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is sometimes useful when the higher-level aggregate object is itself to be related to another object. We call the relationship between the primitive objects and their aggregate object IS-A-PART-OF ; the inverse is called IS-A-COMPONENT-OF . UML provides for all three types of aggregation.132 Chapter 4 The Enhanced Entity–Relationship (EER) Model The abstraction of association  is used to associate objects from several independent classes. Hence, it is somewhat similar to the second use of aggregation.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is repre- sented in the EER model by relationship types, and in UML by associations. This abstract relationship is called IS-ASSOCIATED-WITH . In order to understand the different uses of aggregation better, consider the ER schema shown in Figure 4.11(a), which stores information about interviews by job applicants to various companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The class COMPANY  is an aggregation of the attributes (or component objects) Cname  (company name) and Caddress (company address), whereas JOB_APPLICANT  is an aggregate of Ssn, Name , Address , and Phone . The relationship attributes Contact_name  and Contact_phone represent the name and phone number of the person in the company who is responsible for the interview. Suppose that some interviews result in job offers, whereas others do not. We would like to treat INTERVIEW  as a class to associate it with JOB_OFFER .\n",
      "\n",
      "The schema shown in Figure 4.11(b) is incorrect  because it requires each interview relationship instance to have a job offer. The schema shown in Figure 4.11(c) is not allowed  because the ER model does not allow rela- tionships among relationships. One way to represent this situation is to create a higher-level aggregate class com- posed of COMPANY , JOB_APPLICANT , and INTERVIEW  and to relate this class to JOB_OFFER , as shown in Figure 4.11(d).\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the EER model as described in this book does not have this facility, some semantic data models do allow it and call the resulting object a composite  or molecular object . Other models treat entity types and relationship types uniformly and hence permit relationships among rela- tionships, as illustrated in Figure 4.11(c). To represent this situation correctly in the ER model as described here, we need to create a new weak entity type INTERVIEW , as shown in Figure 4.11(e), and relate it to JOB_OFFER .\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, we can always represent these situations correctly in the ER model by creating additional entity types, although it may be conceptually more desirable to allow direct representation of aggregation, as in Figure 4.11(d), or to allow relationships among relationships, as in Figure 4.11(c). The main structural distinction between aggregation and association is that when an association instance is deleted, the participating objects may continue to exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if we support the notion of an aggregate object—for example, a CAR  that is made up of objects ENGINE , CHASSIS , and TIRES —then deleting the aggregate CAR  object amounts to deleting all its component objects.\n",

      "4.7.5 Ontologies and the Semantic Web In recent years, the amount of computerized data and information available on the Web has spiraled out of control. Many different models and formats are used. In addition to the database models that we present in this text, much information is stored in the form of documents , which have considerably less structure than database information does.\n",
      "\n",
      "One ongoing project that is attempting to allow information exchange among computers on the Web is called the Semantic Web , which attempts to create knowledge representation models that are quite general in order to allow meaningful information exchange and search among machines. The concept of ontology  is considered to be the most promising basis for achieving the goals of the Semantic Web and is closely related to knowledge representation. In this section, we give a brief introduction to what ontology is and how it can be used as a basis to automate information understanding, search, and exchange.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study of ontologies attempts to describe the concepts and relationships that are possible in reality through some common vocabulary; therefore, it can be consid-ered as a way to describe the knowledge of a certain community about reality. Ontology originated in the fields of philosophy and metaphysics. One commonly used definition of ontology  is a specification  of a conceptualization . 13 In this definition, a conceptualization  is the set of concepts and relationships that are used to represent the part of reality or knowledge that is of interest to a com- munity of users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specification  refers to the language and vocabulary terms that are used to specify the conceptualization. The ontology includes both specification  and conceptualization. For example, the same conceptualization may be specified in two different languages, giving two separate ontologies. Based on this general defini-tion, there is no consensus on what an ontology is exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some possible ways to describe ontologies are as follows: ■A thesaurus  (or even a dictionary  or a glossary  of terms) describes the rela- tionships between words (vocabulary) that represent various concepts. ■A taxonomy  describes how concepts of a particular area of knowledge are related using structures similar to those used in a specialization or generalization. ■A detailed database schema  is considered by some to be an ontology that describes the concepts (entities and attributes) and relationships of a mini-world from reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "■A logical theory  uses concepts from mathematical logic to try to define con- cepts and their interrelationships. Usually the concepts used to describe ontologies are similar to the concepts we dis- cuss in conceptual modeling, such as entities, attributes, relationships, specializa- tions, and so on. The main difference between an ontology and, say, a database schema, is that the schema is usually limited to describing a small subset of a mini- world from reality in order to store and manage data.\n",
      "\n",
      "An ontology is usually con- sidered to be more general in that it attempts to describe a part of reality or a domain of interest (for example, medical terms, electronic-commerce applications, sports, and so on) as completely as possible. 13This definition is given in Gruber (1995).

      "4.8 Summary   In this chapter we discussed extensions to the ER model that improve its repre- sentational capabilities. We called the resulting model the enhanced ER or EER model. We presented the concept of a subclass and its superclass and the related mechanism of attribute/relationship inheritance. We saw how it is sometimes necessary to create additional classes of entities, either because of additional spe-cific attributes or because of specific relationship types. We discussed two main processes for defining superclass/subclass hierarchies and lattices: specialization and generalization.\n",

      "Next, we showed how to display these new constructs in an EER diagram. We also discussed the various types of constraints that may apply to specialization or gener-alization. The two main constraints are total/partial and disjoint/overlapping. We discussed the concept of a category or union type, which is a subset of the union of two or more classes, and we gave formal definitions of all the concepts presented. We introduced some of the notation and terminology of UML for representing specialization and generalization.\n",

We saw how EER and UML concepts are related to each of these.\n",

      "﻿5.1 Relational Model Concepts The relational model represents the database as a collection of relations. Informally, each relation resembles a table of values or, to some extent, a flat file of records. It is called a flat file  because each record has a simple linear or flat structure. For exam- ple, the database of files that was shown in Figure 1.2 is similar to the basic rela-tional model representation. However, there are important differences between relations and files, as we shall soon see.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a relation is thought of as a table  of values, each row in the table represents a collection of related data values. A row represents a fact that typically corresponds to a real-world entity or relationship. The table name and column names are used to help to interpret the meaning of the values in each row. For example, the first table of Figure 1.2 is called STUDENT  because each row represents facts about a particular student entity. The column names— Name , Student_number , 1CASE stands for computer-aided software engineering.\n",

      "5.1 Relational Model Concepts  151 Class , and Major —specify how to interpret the data values in each row, based on the column each value is in. All values in a column are of the same data type. In the formal relational model terminology, a row is called a tuple,  a column header is called an attribute,  and the table is called a relation. The data type describing the types of values that can appear in each column is represented by a domain  of possible values.\n",

      "5.1.1 Domains, Attributes, Tuples, and Relations A domain  D is a set of atomic values. By atomic  we mean that each value in the domain is indivisible as far as the formal relational model is concerned. A common method of specifying a domain is to specify a data type from which the data values forming the domain are drawn. It is also useful to specify a name for the domain, to help in interpreting its values. Some examples of domains follow: ■Usa_phone_numbers .\n",
      "\n",
      "The set of ten-digit phone numbers valid in the United States. ■Local_phone_numbers . The set of seven-digit phone numbers valid within a particular area code in the United States.

(This is a unique identifier assigned to each person in the United States for employment, tax, and benefits purposes.)\n",
      "\n",
      "■Names : The set of character strings that represent names of persons. ■Grade_point_averages .

      "\n",
      "■Academic_department_codes . The set of academic department codes, such as ‘CS’, ‘ECON’, and ‘PHYS’. The preceding are called logical  definitions of domains. A data type  or format  is also specified for each domain. For example, the data type for the domain Usa_phone_numbers  can be declared as a character string of the form ( ddd)ddd-dddd , where each d is a numeric (decimal) digit and the first three digits form a valid telephone area code.\n",

      "Hence, if we denote the total number of values, or cardinality,  in a domain D by | D| (assuming that all domains are finite), the total number of tuples in the Cartesian product is |dom( A1)| × |dom( A2)| × . . . × |dom( An)| This product of cardinalities of all domains represents the total number of possible instances or tuples that can ever exist in any relation state r(R).\n",
      "\n",
      "Of all these possible combinations, a relation state at a given time—the current relation state —reflects only the valid tuples that represent a particular state of the real world. In general, as the state of the real world changes, so does the relation state, by being transformed into another relation state. However, the schema R is relatively static and changes very infrequently—for example, as a result of adding an attribute to represent new information that was not originally stored in the relation. It is possible for several attributes to have the same domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The attribute names indi- cate different roles , or interpretations, for the domain. For example, in the STUDENT relation, the same domain USA_phone_numbers  plays the role of Home_phone , referring to the home phone of a student , and the role of Office_phone , referring to the office phone of the student . A third possible attribute (not shown) with the same domain could be Mobile_phone .\n",

      "5.1.2 Characteristics of Relations The earlier definition of relations implies certain characteristics that make a rela-tion different from a file or a table. We now discuss some of these characteristics. {Figure 5.1: A table titled STUDENT, with columns Name, SSN, Home_phone, Address, Office_phone, Age, GPA. Arrows pointing to column names with label “Attributes”. Arrows pointing to table rows with label “tuples”} The relation STUDENT from Figure 5.1 with a different order of tuples.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.1 Relational Model Concepts  155 two tuples shown in Figure 5.3 are identical. This makes sense at an abstract level, since there really is no reason to prefer having one attribute value appear before another in a tuple. When the attribute name and value are included together in a tuple, it is known as self-describing data , because the description of each value (attribute name) is included in the tuple.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will mostly use the first definition  of relation, where the attributes are ordered in the relation schema and the values within tuples are similarly ordered,  because it simplifies much of the notation. However, the alternative definition given here is more general. 5 Values and NULLs in the Tuples. Each value in a tuple is an atomic  value; that is, it is not divisible into components within the framework of the basic relational model. Hence, composite and multivalued attributes (see Chapter 3) are not allowed. This model is sometimes called the flat relational model .\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of the theory behind the relational model was developed with this assumption in mind, which is called the first normal form  assumption. 6 Hence, multivalued attributes must be represented by separate relations, and composite attributes are represented only by their simple component attributes in the basic relational model.7 An important concept is that of NULL  values, which are used to represent the values of attributes that may be unknown or may not apply to a tuple. A special value, called NULL , is used in these cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in Figure 5.1, some STUDENT  tuples have NULL  for their office phones because they do not have an office (that is, office phone does not apply  to these students). Another student has a NULL  for home phone, presum- ably because either he does not have a home phone or he has one but we do not know it (value is unknown ).\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, we can have several meanings for NULL  values, such as value unknown , value  exists but is not available , or attribute does not apply  to this tuple (also known as value undefined ). An example of the last type of NULL  will occur if we add an attribute Visa_status  to the STUDENT  relation that applies only to tuples repre- senting foreign students. It is possible to devise different codes for different meanings of 5We will use the alternative definition of relation when we discuss query processing and optimization in Chapter 18.\n",
      "\n",
      "6We discuss this assumption in more detail in Chapter 14. 7Extensions of the relational model remove these restrictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, object-relational systems (Chapter 12) allow complex-structured attributes, as do the non-first normal form  or nested  relational models.t = < (Name, Dick Davidson),(Ssn, 422-11-2320),(Home_phone, NULL),(Address, 3452 Elgin Road), (Office_phone, (817)749-1253),(Age, 25),(Gpa, 3.53)> t = < (Address, 3452 Elgin Road),(Name, Dick Davidson),(Ssn, 422-11-2320),(Age, 25), (Office_phone, (817)749-1253),(Gpa, 3.53),(Home_phone, NULL)> Figure 5.3 Two identical tuples when the order of attributes and values is not part of relation definition.156 Chapter 5 The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints NULL  values.\n",
      "\n",
      "Incorporating different types of NULL  values into relational model opera- tions has proven difficult and is outside the scope of our presentation. The exact meaning of a NULL  value governs how it fares during arithmetic aggrega- tions or comparisons with other values. For example, a comparison of two NULL values leads to ambiguities—if both Customer A and B have NULL  addresses, it does not mean  they have the same address. During database design, it is best to avoid NULL  values as much as possible.\n",

      "We will discuss this further in Chapters 7 and 8 in the context of operations and queries, and in Chapter 14 in the context of database design and normalization. Interpretation (Meaning) of a Relation. The relation schema can be interpreted as a declaration or a type of assertion . For example, the schema of the STUDENT relation of Figure 5.1 asserts that, in general, a student entity has a Name , Ssn, Home_phone , Address , Office_phone , Age, and Gpa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each tuple in the relation can then be interpreted as a fact or a particular instance of the assertion. For example, the first tuple in Figure 5.1 asserts the fact that there is a STUDENT  whose Name  is Benjamin Bayer, Ssn is 305-61-2435, Age is 19, and so on. Notice that some relations may represent facts about entities,  whereas other rela- tions may represent facts about relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, a relation schema MAJORS  (Student_ssn, Department_code ) asserts that students major in academic disciplines. A tuple in this relation relates a student to his or her major discipline. Hence, the relational model represents facts about both entities and relationships uniformly  as relations. This sometimes compromises understandability because one has to guess whether a relation represents an entity type or a relationship type. We introduced the entity–relationship (ER) model in detail in Chapter 3, where the entity and relationship concepts were described in detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mapping procedures in Chapter 9 show how different constructs of the ER/EER conceptual data models (see Part 2) get converted to relations. An alternative interpretation of a relation schema is as a predicate ; in this case, the values in each tuple are interpreted as values that satisfy  the predicate. For example, the predicate STUDENT  (Name , Ssn, …) is true for the five tuples in relation STUDENT of Figure 5.1. These tuples represent five different propositions or facts in the real world.\n",
      "\n",
      "This interpretation is quite useful in the context of logical programming languages, such as Prolog, because it allows the relational model to be used within these languages (see Section 26.5). An assumption called the closed world assumption states that the only true facts in the universe are those present within the extension (state) of the relation(s). Any other combination of values makes the predicate false. This interpretation is useful when we consider queries on relations based on  relational calculus in Section 8.6.\n",

      "5.1.3 Relational Model Notation We will use the following notation in our presentation: ■A relation schema R of degree n is denoted by R(A1, A2, … , An). 5.2 Relational Model Constraints and Relational Database Schemas  157 ■The uppercase letters Q, R, S denote relation names. ■The lowercase letters q, r, s denote relation states. ■The letters t, u, v denote tuples.\n",
      "\n",
      "■In general, the name of a relation schema such as STUDENT  also indicates the current set of tuples in that relation—the current relation state —whereas STUDENT (Name , Ssn, …) refers only to the relation schema. ■An attribute A can be qualified with the relation name R to which it belongs by using the dot notation R.A—for example, STUDENT.Name  or STUDENT.Age . This is because the same name may be used for two attri- butes in different relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, all attribute names in a particular relation  must be distinct. ■An n-tuple t in a relation r(R) is denoted by t = <v1, v2, … , vn>, where vi is the value corresponding to attribute Ai. The following notation refers to component values  of tuples: /box4Both t[Ai] and t.Ai (and sometimes t[i]) refer to the value vi in t for attri- bute Ai.\n",

      "5.2  Relational Model Constraints and Relational Database Schemas So far, we have discussed the characteristics of single relations. In a relational data- base, there will typically be many relations, and the tuples in those relations are usually related in various ways. The state of the whole database will correspond to the states of all its relations at a particular point in time. There are generally many restrictions or constraints  on the actual values in a database state.\n",
      "\n",
      "These constraints are derived from the rules in the miniworld that the database represents, as we dis-cussed in Section 1.6.8. In this section, we discuss the various restrictions on data that can be specified on a relational database in the form of constraints. Constraints on databases can gener-ally be divided into three main categories: 1. Constraints that are inherent in the data model. We call these inherent model-based constraints  or implicit constraints . 2.\n",

      "Constraints that can be directly expressed in the schemas of the data model, typi- cally by specifying them in the DDL (data definition language, see Section 2.3.1). We call these schema-based constraints  or explicit constraints .158 Chapter 5 The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints 3. Constraints that cannot  be directly expressed in the schemas of the data model, and hence must be expressed and enforced by the application pro-grams or in some other way.\n",
      "\n",
      "We call these application-based  or semantic constraints  or business rules . The characteristics of relations that we discussed in Section 5.1.2 are the inherent constraints of the relational model and belong to the first category. For example, the constraint that a relation cannot have duplicate tuples is an inherent constraint. The constraints we discuss in this section are of the second category, namely, constraints that can be expressed in the schema of the relational model via the DDL.\n",
      "\n",
      "Constraints in the third category are more general, relate to the meaning as well as behavior of attributes, and are difficult to express and enforce within the data model, so they are usually checked within the application programs that perform database updates. In some cases, these constraints can be specified as assertions  in SQL (see Chapter 7). Another important category of constraints is data dependencies , which include functional dependencies  and multivalued dependencies .\n",
      "\n",
      "They are used mainly for testing the “goodness” of the design of a relational database and are utilized in a process called normalization , which is discussed in Chapters 14 and 15. The schema-based constraints include domain constraints, key constraints, con- straints on NULLs , entity integrity constraints, and referential integrity constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.2.1 Domain Constraints Domain constraints specify that within each tuple, the value of each attribute A must be an atomic value from the domain dom( A). We have already discussed the ways in which domains can be specified in Section 5.1.1. The data types associated with domains typically include standard numeric data types for integers (such as short integer, integer, and long integer) and real numbers (float and double-precision float).\n",
      "\n",
      "Characters, Booleans, fixed-length strings, and variable-length strings are also avail-able, as are date, time, timestamp, and other special data types. Domains can also be described by a subrange of values from a data type or as an enumerated data type in which all possible values are explicitly listed. Rather than describe these in detail here, we discuss the data types offered by the SQL relational standard in Section 6.1.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.2.2 Key Constraints and Constraints on NULL Values In the formal relational model, a relation  is defined as a set of tuples. By definition, all elements of a set are distinct; hence, all tuples in a relation must also be distinct. This means that no two tuples can have the same combination of values for all their attributes. Usually, there are other subsets of attributes  of a relation schema R with the property that no two tuples in any relation state r of R should have the same combination of values for these attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose that we denote one such subset of attributes by SK; then for any two distinct  tuples t 1 and t2 in a relation state r of R, we have the constraint that: t1[SK] ≠ t2[SK] 5.2 Relational Model Constraints and Relational Database Schemas  159 Any such set of attributes SK is called a superkey  of the relation schema R. A super- key SK specifies a uniqueness constraint  that no two distinct tuples in any state r of R can have the same value for SK.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every relation has at least one default superkey— the set of all its attributes. A superkey can have redundant attributes, however, so a more useful concept is that of a key, which has no redundancy. A key k of a relation schema R is a superkey of R with the additional property that removing any attri- bute A from K leaves a set of attributes K′ that is not a superkey of R any more. Hence, a key satisfies two properties: 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two distinct tuples in any state of the relation cannot have identical values for (all) the attributes in the key. This uniqueness  property also applies to a superkey. 2. It is a minimal superkey —that is, a superkey from which we cannot remove any attributes and still have the uniqueness constraint hold. This minimality property is required for a key but is optional for a superkey. Hence, a key is a superkey but not vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "A superkey may be a key (if it is mini- mal) or may not be a key (if it is not minimal). Consider the STUDENT  relation of Figure 5.1. The attribute set { Ssn} is a key of STUDENT  because no two student tuples can have the same value for Ssn.8 Any set of attributes that includes Ssn—for example, { Ssn, Name , Age}—is a superkey.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the superkey { Ssn, Name , Age} is not a key of STUDENT  because removing Name  or Age or both from the set still leaves us with a superkey. In general, any superkey formed from a single attribute is also a key. A key with multiple attributes must require all its attributes together to have the uniqueness property. The value of a key attribute can be used to identify uniquely each tuple in the rela- tion.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the Ssn value 305-61-2435 identifies uniquely the tuple corre- sponding to Benjamin Bayer in the STUDENT  relation. Notice that a set of attributes constituting a key is a property of the relation schema; it is a constraint that should hold on every  valid relation state of the schema. A key is determined from the mean- ing of the attributes, and the property is time-invariant:  It must continue to hold when we insert new tuples in the relation.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we cannot and should not designate the Name  attribute of the STUDENT  relation in Figure 5.1 as a key because it is possible that two students with identical names will exist at some point in a valid state.9 In general, a relation schema may have more than one key. In this case, each of the keys is called a candidate key . For example, the CAR  relation in Figure 5.4 has two candidate keys: License_number  and Engine_serial_number .\n",
      "\n",
      "It is common to designate one of the candidate keys as the primary key  of the relation. This is the candidate key whose values are used to identify  tuples in the relation. We use the convention that the attributes that form the primary key of a relation schema are underlined, as shown in Figure 5.4. Notice that when a relation schema has several candidate keys, 8Note that Ssn is also a superkey.\n",

The other candidate keys are designated as unique keys  and are not underlined. Another constraint on attributes specifies whether NULL  values are or are not per- mitted.\n",
      "\n",

A relational database usually contains many relations, with tuples in relations that are related in various ways. In this section, we define a rela-tional database and a relational database schema.

      "In Figure 5.5, the Dnumber  attribute in both DEPARTMENT  and DEPT_LOCATIONS stands for the same real-world concept—the number given to a department.

Alternatively, attributes that represent different concepts may have the same name in different relations.\n",

In some early versions of the relational model, an assumption was made that the same real-world concept, when represented by an attribute, would have identical attribute names in all relations. This creates problems when the same real-world concept is used in different roles (meanings) in the same relation.\n",

In addition to domain, key, and NOT NULL constraints, two other types of constraints are considered part of the relational model: entity integrity and referential integrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.2.4 Entity Integrity, Referential Integrity, and Foreign Keys The entity integrity constraint  states that no primary key value can be NULL . This is because the primary key value is used to identify individual tuples in a relation. Hav-ing NULL  values for the primary key implies that we cannot identify some tuples. For example, if two or more tuples had NULL  for their primary keys, we may not be able to distinguish them if we try to reference them from other relations. Key constraints and entity integrity constraints are specified on individual relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The referential integrity constraint  is specified between two relations and is used to maintain the consistency among tuples in the two relations. Informally, the referen-tial integrity constraint states that a tuple in one relation that refers to another rela-tion must refer to an existing tuple  in that relation. For example, in Figure 5.6, the attribute Dno of EMPLOYEE  gives the department number for which each employee works; hence, its value in every EMPLOYEE  tuple must match the Dnumber  value of some tuple in the DEPARTMENT  relation.\n",
      "\n",
      "To define referential integrity  more formally, first we define the concept of a foreign key. The conditions for a foreign key, given below, specify a referential integrity constraint between the two relation schemas R1 and R2. A set of attributes FK in relation schema R1 is a foreign key  of R1 that references  relation R2 if it satisfies the following rules: 1. The attributes in FK have the same domain(s) as the primary key attributes PK of R 2; the attributes FK are said to reference  or refer to  the relation R2. 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "A value of FK in a tuple t1 of the current state r1(R1) either occurs as a value of PK for some tuple t2 in the current state r2(R2) or is NULL . In the former case, we have t1[FK] = t2[PK], and we say that the tuple t1 references  or refers to  the tuple t2. In this definition, R1 is called the referencing relation  and R2 is the referenced relation .\n",
      "\n",
      "If these two conditions hold, a referential integrity constraint  from R1 to R2 is said to hold. In a database of many relations, there are usually many referential integrity constraints. To specify these constraints, first we must have a clear understanding of the mean- ing or role that each attribute or set of attributes plays in the various relation sche-mas of the database. Referential integrity constraints typically arise from the relationships among the entities  represented by the relation schemas. For example, consider the database shown in Figure 5.6.\n",

Notice that a foreign key can refer to its own relation. For example, the attribute Super_ssn  in EMPLOYEE  refers to the supervisor of an employee; this is another employee, represented by a tuple in the EMPLOYEE  relation. Hence, Super_ssn  is a foreign key that references the EMPLOYEE  relation itself.\n",

      "In Figure 5.6 the tuple for employee ‘John Smith’ references the tuple for employee ‘Franklin Wong,’ indicat-ing that ‘Franklin Wong’ is the supervisor of ‘John Smith’.

Another class of general con-straints, sometimes called semantic integrity constraints,  are not part of the DDL and have to be specified and enforced in a different way. Examples of such con-straints are the salary of an employee should not exceed the salary of the employee’s supervisor  and the maximum number of hours an employee can work on all projects per week is 56 .\n",

      "The types of constraints we discussed so far may be called state constraints because they define the constraints that a valid state  of the database must satisfy. Another type of constraint, called transition constraints , can be defined to deal with state changes in the database. 11 An example of a transition constraint is: “the salary of an employee can only increase.” Such constraints are typically enforced by the application programs or specified using active rules and triggers, as we dis-cuss in Section 26.1.\n",

      "5.3  Update Operations, Transactions,   and Dealing with Constraint Violations The operations of the relational model can be categorized into retrievals  and updates. The relational algebra operations, which can be used to specify retrievals , are discussed in detail in Chapter 8. A relational algebra expression forms a new relation after applying a number of algebraic operators to an existing set of rela-tions; its main use is for querying a database to retrieve information.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user for-mulates a query that specifies the data of interest, and a new relation is formed by applying relational operators to retrieve this data. The result relation  becomes the answer to (or result of) the user’s query. Chapter 8 also introduces the language 11State constraints are sometimes called static constraints , and transition constraints are sometimes called dynamic constraints .166 Chapter 5 The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints called relational calculus, which is used to define a query declaratively without giv- ing a specific order of operations.\n",

      "In this section, we concentrate on the database modification  or update  operations. There are three basic operations that can change the states of relations in the data-base: Insert, Delete, and Update (or Modify). They insert new data, delete old data, or modify existing data records, respectively. Insert  is used to insert one or more new tuples in a relation, Delete  is used to delete tuples, and Update  (or Modify ) is used to change the values of some attributes in existing tuples.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever these operations are applied, the integrity constraints specified on the relational database schema should not be violated. In this section we discuss the types of constraints that may be violated by each of these operations and the types of actions that may be taken if an operation causes a violation. We use the database shown in Figure 5.6 for examples and discuss only domain constraints, key constraints, entity integrity constraints, and the referential integrity constraints shown in Figure 5.7. For each type of operation, we give some examples and discuss any constraints that each operation may violate.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.3.1 The Insert Operation The Insert  operation provides a list of attribute values for a new tuple t that is to be inserted into a relation R. Insert can violate any of the four types of constraints. Domain constraints can be violated if an attribute value is given that does not appear in the corresponding domain or is not of the appropriate data type. Key constraints can be violated if a key value in the new tuple t already exists in another tuple in the relation r(R). Entity integrity can be violated if any part of the primary key of the new tuple t is NULL .\n",
      "\n",
      "Referential integrity can be violated if the value of any foreign key in t refers to a tuple that does not exist in the referenced relation. Here are some examples to illustrate this discussion. ■Operation : Insert <‘Cecilia’ , ‘F’ , ‘Kolonsky’ , NULL , ‘1960-04-05’ , ‘6357 Windy Lane, Katy, TX’ , F, 28000, NULL , 4> into EMPLOYEE .\n",

In this case, it would be useful if the DBMS could provide a reason to the user as to why the insertion was rejected. Another option is to attempt to correct the reason for rejecting the insertion,  but this is typically not used for violations caused by Insert ; rather, it is used more often in correcting violations for Delete and Update.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first operation, the DBMS could ask the user to provide a value for Ssn, and could then accept the insertion if a valid Ssn value is provided. In operation 3, the DBMS could either ask the user to change the value of Dno to some valid value (or set it to NULL ), or it could ask the user to insert a DEPARTMENT  tuple with Dnumber  = 7 and could accept the original insertion only after such an operation was accepted.\n",

      "5.3.2 The Delete Operation The Delete  operation can violate only referential integrity. This occurs if the tuple being deleted is referenced by foreign keys from other tuples in the database. To specify deletion, a condition on the attributes of the relation selects the tuple (or tuples) to be deleted. Here are some examples. ■Operation : Delete the WORKS_ON  tuple with Essn  = ‘999887777’ and Pno = 10. Result : This deletion is acceptable and deletes exactly one tuple.\n",

      "\n",
      "Result : This deletion will result in even worse referential integrity violations, because the tuple involved is referenced by tuples from the EMPLOYEE , DEPARTMENT , WORKS_ON , and DEPENDENT  relations. Several options are available if a deletion operation causes a violation. The first option, called restrict,  is to reject the deletion. The second option, called cascade,  is to attempt to cascade (or propagate) the deletion  by deleting tuples that reference the tuple that is being deleted.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in operation 2, the DBMS could automati-cally delete the offending tuples from WORKS_ON  with Essn  = ‘999887777’. A third option, called set null  or set default,  is to modify the referencing attribute values  that cause the violation; each such value is either set to NULL  or changed to 168 Chapter 5 The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints reference another default valid tuple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that if a referencing attribute that causes a violation is part of the primary key,  it cannot  be set to NULL ; otherwise, it would violate entity integrity. Combinations of these three options are also possible. For example, to avoid having operation 3 cause a violation, the DBMS may automatically delete all tuples from WORKS_ON  and DEPENDENT  with Essn  = ‘333445555’.\n",

      "Tuples in EMPLOYEE  with Super_ssn  = ‘333445555’ and the tuple in DEPARTMENT  with Mgr_ssn  = ‘333445555’ can have their Super_ssn  and Mgr_ssn  values changed to other valid values or to NULL .\n",
      "\n",
      "Although it may make sense to delete automatically the WORKS_ON  and DEPENDENT  tuples that refer to an EMPLOYEE  tuple, it may not make sense to delete other EMPLOYEE  tuples or a DEPARTMENT  tuple. In general, when a referential integrity constraint is specified in the DDL, the DBMS will allow the database designer to specify which of the options  applies in case of a violation of the constraint. We discuss how to specify these options in the SQL DDL in Chapter 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.3.3 The Update Operation The Update  (or Modify ) operation is used to change the values of one or more attributes in a tuple (or tuples) of some relation R. It is necessary to specify a condi- tion on the attributes of the relation to select the tuple (or tuples) to be modified. Here are some examples. ■Operation : Update the salary of the EMPLOYEE  tuple with Ssn = ‘999887777’ to 28000. Result : Acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Operation : Update the Dno of the EMPLOYEE  tuple with Ssn = ‘999887777’ to 1. Result : Acceptable. ■Operation : Update the Dno of the EMPLOYEE  tuple with Ssn = ‘999887777’ to 7. Result : Unacceptable, because it violates referential integrity.\n",

      "■Operation : Update the Ssn of the EMPLOYEE  tuple with Ssn = ‘999887777’ to ‘987654321’ . Result : Unacceptable, because it violates primary key constraint by repeating a value that already exists as a primary key in another tuple; it violates refer-ential integrity constraints because there are other relations that refer to the existing value of Ssn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Updating an attribute that is neither part of a primary key nor part of a foreign key usually causes no problems; the DBMS need only check to confirm that the new value is of the correct data type and domain. Modifying a primary key value is simi- lar to deleting one tuple and inserting another in its place because we use the pri- mary key to identify tuples. Hence, the issues discussed earlier in both Sections 5.3.1 (Insert) and 5.3.2 (Delete) come into play.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a foreign key attribute is modified, the  5.4 Summary  169 DBMS must make sure that the new value refers to an existing tuple in the refer- enced relation (or is set to NULL ). Similar options exist to deal with referential integ- rity violations caused by Update as those options discussed for the Delete operation. In fact, when a referential integrity constraint is specified in the DDL, the DBMS will allow the user to choose separate options to deal with a violation caused by Delete and a violation caused by Update (see Section 6.2).\n",

      "5.3.4 The Transaction Concept A database application program running against a relational database typically exe-cutes one or more transactions . A transaction  is an executing program that includes some database operations, such as reading from the database, or applying inser-tions, deletions, or updates to the database. At the end of the transaction, it must leave the database in a valid or consistent state that satisfies all the constraints spec-ified on the database schema.\n",
      "\n",
      "A single transaction may involve any number of retrieval operations (to be discussed as part of relational algebra and calculus in Chapter 8, and as a part of the language SQL in Chapters 6 and 7) and any number of update operations. These retrievals and updates will together form an atomic unit of work against the database. For example, a transaction to apply a bank with-drawal will typically read the user account record, check if there is a sufficient bal-ance, and then update the record by the withdrawal amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "A large number of commercial applications running against relational databases in online transaction processing (OLTP ) systems are executing transactions at rates that reach several hundred per second.

      "5.4 Summary   In this chapter we presented the modeling concepts, data structures, and constraints provided by the relational model of data. We started by introducing the concepts of domains, attributes, and tuples. Then, we defined a relation schema as a list of attri- butes that describe the structure of a relation. A relation, or relation state, is a set of tuples that conforms to the schema. Several characteristics differentiate relations from ordinary tables or files. The first is that a relation is not sensitive to the ordering of tuples.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second involves the ordering of attributes in a relation schema and the corresponding ordering of val- ues within a tuple. We gave an alternative definition of relation that does not require ordering of attributes, but we continued to use the first definition, which requires attributes and tuple values to be ordered, for convenience. Then, we discussed val-ues in tuples and introduced NULL  values to represent missing or unknown infor- mation. We emphasized that NULL  values should be avoided as much as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "We classified database constraints into inherent model-based constraints, explicit schema-based constraints, and semantic constraints or business rules. Then, we 170 Chapter 5 The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints discussed the schema constraints pertaining to the relational model, starting with domain constraints, then key constraints (including the concepts of superkey, key, and primary key), and the NOT NULL  constraint on attributes. We defined relational databases and relational database schemas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional relational con-straints include the entity integrity constraint, which prohibits primary key attri-butes from being NULL . We described the interrelation referential integrity constraint, which is used to maintain consistency of references among tuples from various relations. The modification operations on the relational model are Insert, Delete, and Update. Each operation may violate certain types of constraints (refer to Section 5.3). When-ever an operation is applied, the resulting database state must be a valid state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we introduced the concept of a transaction, which is important in relational DBMSs because it allows the grouping of several database operations into a single atomic action on the database. Review Questions\n",

      " SQL uses the terms table , row, and column  for the formal relational model terms relation , tuple , and attribute , respectively. We will use the corresponding terms interchangeably. The main SQL command for data definition is the CREATE  state- ment, which can be used to create schemas, tables (relations), types, and domains, as well as other constructs such as views, assertions, and triggers. Before we describe the relevant CREATE  statements, we discuss schema and catalog concepts in Sec- tion 6.1.1 to place our discussion in perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 6.1.2 describes how tables are created, and Section 6.1.3 describes the most important data types available for attribute specification. Because the SQL specification is very large, we give a descrip-tion of the most important features. Further details can be found in the various SQL standards documents (see end-of-chapter bibliographic notes).\n",
      "\n",
      "6.1.1 Schema and Catalog Concepts in SQL Early versions of SQL did not include the concept of a relational database schema; all tables (relations) were considered part of the same schema. The concept of an SQL schema was incorporated starting with SQL2 in order to group together tables and other constructs that belong to the same database application (in some systems, a schema  is called a database ).\n",
      "\n",
      "An SQL schema  is identified by a schema name  and includes an authorization identifier  to indicate the user or account who owns the schema, as well as descriptors  for each element  in the schema. Schema elements include tables, types, constraints, views, domains, and other constructs (such as authorization grants) that describe the schema. A schema is created via the CREATE SCHEMA  statement, which can include all the schema elements’ definitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alter- natively, the schema can be assigned a name and authorization identifier, and the 180 Chapter 6 Basic SQL elements can be defined later. For example, the following statement creates a schema called COMPANY  owned by the user with authorization identifier ‘Jsmith’. Note that each statement in SQL ends with a semicolon. CREATE SCHEMA  COMPANY  AUTHORIZATION  ‘Jsmith’; In general, not all users are authorized to create schemas and schema elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The privilege to create schemas, tables, and other constructs must be explicitly granted to the relevant user accounts by the system administrator or DBA. In addition to the concept of a schema, SQL uses the concept of a catalog —a named collection of schemas. 2 Database installations typically have a default environment and schema, so when a user connects and logs in to that database installation, the user can refer directly to tables and other constructs within that schema without having to specify a particular schema name.\n",
      "\n",
      "A catalog always contains a special schema called INFORMATION_SCHEMA , which provides information on all the schemas in the catalog and all the element descriptors in these schemas. Integrity constraints such as referential integrity can be defined between relations only if they exist in schemas within the same catalog. Schemas within the same catalog can also share certain elements, such as type and domain definitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.1.2 The CREATE TABLE Command in SQL The CREATE TABLE  command is used to specify a new relation by giving it a name and specifying its attributes and initial constraints. The attributes are specified first, and each attribute is given a name, a data type to specify its domain of values, and possibly attribute constraints, such as NOT NULL . The key, entity integrity, and ref- erential integrity constraints can be specified within the CREATE TABLE  statement after the attributes are declared, or they can be added later using the ALTER TABLE command (see Chapter 7).\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 6.1 shows sample data definition statements in SQL for the COMPANY  relational database schema shown in Figure 3.7. Typically, the SQL schema in which the relations are declared is implicitly specified in the environment in which the CREATE TABLE  statements are executed. Alterna- tively, we can explicitly attach the schema name to the relation name, separated by a period.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, by writing CREATE TABLE  COMPANY.EMPLOYEE rather than CREATE TABLE  EMPLOYEE as in Figure 6.1, we can explicitly (rather than implicitly) make the EMPLOYEE  table part of the COMPANY  schema. The relations declared through CREATE TABLE  statements are called base tables (or base relations); this means that the table and its rows are actually created 2SQL also includes the concept of a cluster  of catalogs.\n",

      "\n",
      "Base relations are distinguished from virtual relations , created through the CREATE VIEW  statement (see Chapter 7), which may or may not correspond to an actual physical file. In SQL, the attributes in a base table are considered to be ordered in the sequence in which they are speci- fied in the CREATE TABLE  statement. However, rows (tuples) are not considered to be ordered within a table (relation).\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that in Figure 6.1, there are some foreign keys that may cause errors  because they are specified either via circular references or because they refer to a table that has not yet been created. For example, the foreign key Super_ssn  in the EMPLOYEE  table is a circular reference because it refers to the EMPLOYEE  table itself. The foreign key Dno in the EMPLOYEE  table refers to the DEPARTMENT  table, which has not been created yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "To deal with this type of problem, these constraints can be left out of the initial CREATE TABLE  statement, and then added later using the ALTER TABLE  statement (see Chapter 7). We displayed all the foreign keys in Figure 6.1 to show the complete COMPANY  schema in one place.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.1.3 Attribute Data Types and Domains in SQL The basic data types  available for attributes include numeric, character string, bit string, Boolean, date, and time. ■Numeric  data types include integer numbers of various sizes ( INTEGER  or INT, and SMALLINT ) and floating-point (real) numbers of various precision (FLOAT  or REAL , and DOUBLE PRECISION ).\n",
      "\n",
      "Formatted numbers can be declared by using DECIMAL (i, j)—or DEC (i, j) or NUMERIC (i, j)—where i, the precision , is the total number of decimal digits and j, the scale , is the number of digits after the decimal point. The default for scale is zero, and the default for precision is implementation-defined.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Character-string  data types are either fixed length— CHAR (n) or CHARACTER (n), where n is the number of characters—or varying length— VARCHAR (n) or CHAR VARYING (n) or CHARACTER VARYING (n), where n is the maximum number of characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "When specifying a literal string value, it is placed between single quotation marks (apostrophes), and it is case sen- sitive  (a distinction is made between uppercase and lowercase).3 For fixed- length strings, a shorter string is padded with blank characters to the right. For example, if the value ‘Smith’ is for an attribute of type CHAR (10), it is padded with five blank characters to become ‘Smith’ if needed. Padded blanks are generally ignored when strings are compared.\n",
      "\n",
      "For comparison purposes, strings are considered ordered in alphabetic (or lexicographic) order; if a string str1 appears before another string str2 in alphabetic order, then str1 is considered to be less than str2.4 There is also a concatenation operator denoted by || (double vertical bar) that can concatenate two strings 3This is not the case with SQL keywords, such as CREATE or CHAR. With keywords, SQL is case insen- sitive , meaning that SQL treats uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent in keywords.\n",
      "\n",
      "4For nonalphabetic characters, there is a defined order. 6.1 SQL Data Definition and Data Types  183 in SQL. For example, ‘abc’ || ‘XYZ’ results in a single string ‘abcXYZ’. Another variable-length string data type called CHARACTER LARGE OBJECT or CLOB  is also available to specify columns that have large text values, such as documents. The CLOB maximum length can be specified in kilobytes (K), megabytes (M), or gigabytes (G).\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, CLOB (20M) specifies a maximum length of 20 megabytes. ■Bit-string  data types are either of fixed length n—BIT(n)—or varying length— BIT VARYING (n), where n is the maximum number of bits. The default for n, the length of a character string or bit string, is 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Literal bit strings are placed between single quotes but preceded by a B to distinguish them from character strings; for example, B‘10101’.5 Another variable-length bitstring data type called BINARY LARGE OBJECT  or BLOB  is also available to specify columns that have large binary values, such as images. As for CLOB , the maximum length of a BLOB  can be specified in kilobits (K), megabits (M), or gigabits (G).\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, BLOB (30G) specifies a maximum length of 30 gigabits. ■A Boolean  data type has the traditional values of TRUE  or FALSE . In SQL, because of the presence of NULL  values, a three-valued logic is used, so a third possible value for a Boolean data type is UNKNOWN . We discuss the need for UNKNOWN  and the three-valued logic in Chapter 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "■The DATE  data type has ten positions, and its components are YEAR , MONTH , and DAY in the form YYYY-MM-DD. The TIME  data type has at least eight positions, with the components HOUR , MINUTE , and SECOND  in the form HH:MM:SS. Only valid dates and times should be allowed by the SQL imple- mentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This implies that months should be between 1 and 12 and days must be between 01 and 31; furthermore, a day should be a valid day for the corresponding month. The < (less than) comparison can be used with dates or times—an earlier  date is considered to be smaller than a later date, and similarly with time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Literal values are represented by single-quoted strings preceded by the keyword DATE  or TIME ; for example, DATE  ‘2014-09-27’ or TIME  ‘09:12:47’. In addition, a data type TIME (i), where i is called time frac- tional seconds precision , specifies i + 1 additional positions for TIME —one position for an additional period (.) separator character, and i positions for specifying decimal fractions of a second.\n",
      "\n",
      "A TIME WITH TIME ZONE  data type includes an additional six positions for specifying the displacement  from the standard universal time zone, which is in the range +13:00 to –12:59 in units of HOURS:MINUTES . If WITH TIME ZONE  is not included, the default is the local time zone for the SQL session. Some additional data types are discussed below. The list of types discussed here is not exhaustive; different implementations have added more data types to SQL.\n",
      "\n",
      "■A timestamp  data type ( TIMESTAMP ) includes the DATE  and TIME  fields, plus a minimum of six positions for decimal fractions of seconds and an optional WITH TIME ZONE  qualifier.\n",

      "\n",
      "■Another data type related to DATE , TIME , and TIMESTAMP  is the INTERVAL  data type. This specifies an interval —a relative value  that can be used to increment or decrement an absolute value of a date, time, or timestamp. Intervals are qualified to be either YEAR/MONTH  intervals or DAY/TIME  intervals. The format of DATE , TIME , and TIMESTAMP  can be considered as a special type of string.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, they can generally be used in string comparisons by being cast (or coerced  or converted) into the equivalent strings. It is possible to specify the data type of each attribute directly, as in Figure 6.1; alter- natively, a domain can be declared, and the domain name can be used with the attribute specification. This makes it easier to change the data type for a domain that is used by numerous attributes in a schema, and improves schema readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we can create a domain SSN_TYPE by  the following statement: CREATE DOMAIN  SSN_TYPE AS CHAR(9); We can use SSN_TYPE  in place of CHAR (9) in Figure 6.1 for the attributes Ssn and Super_ssn  of EMPLOYEE , Mgr_ssn  of DEPARTMENT , Essn  of WORKS_ON , and Essn of DEPENDENT . A domain can also have an optional default specification via a DEFAULT  clause, as we discuss later for attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that domains may not be available in some implementations of SQL. In SQL, there is also a CREATE TYPE  command, which can be used to create user defined types or UDTs. These can then be used either as data types for attributes, or as the basis for creating tables. We shall discuss CREATE TYPE in detail in Chap-ter 12, because it is often used in conjunction with specifying object database features that have been incorporated into more recent versions of SQL.\n",

      "6.2 Specifying Constraints in SQL   This section describes the basic constraints that can be specified in SQL as part of table creation. These include key and referential integrity constraints, restrictions on attribute domains and NULL s, and constraints on individual tuples within a rela- tion using the CHECK clause. We discuss the specification of more general con-straints, called assertions, in Chapter 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.2.1 Specifying Attribute Constraints and Attribute Defaults Because SQL allows NULL s as attribute values, a constraint  NOT NULL  may be specified if NULL  is not permitted for a particular attribute. This is always implicitly specified for the attributes that are part of the primary key  of each relation, but it can be specified for any other attributes whose values are required not to be NULL , as shown in Figure 6.1. It is also possible to define a default value  for an attribute by appending the clause DEFAULT  <value> to an attribute definition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The default value is included in any  6.2 Specifying Constraints in SQL  185 new tuple if an explicit value is not provided for that attribute. Figure 6.2 illustrates an example of specifying a default manager for a new department and a default department for a new employee. If no default clause is specified, the default default value  is NULL  for attributes that do not have  the NOT NULL  constraint.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another type of constraint can restrict attribute or domain values using the CHECK clause following an attribute or domain definition.6 For example, suppose that department numbers are restricted to integer numbers between 1 and 20; then, we can change the attribute declaration of Dnumber  in the DEPARTMENT  table (see Fig- ure 6.1) to the following: Dnumber INT NOT NULL  CHECK  (Dnumber > 0 AND  Dnumber <  21); The CHECK  clause can also be used in conjunction with the CREATE DOMAIN  state- ment.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we can write the following statement: CREATE DOMAIN  D_NUM AS INTEGER CHECK  (D_NUM > 0 AND  D_NUM < 21); 6The CHECK clause can also be used for other purposes, as we shall see.CREATE TABLE  EMPLOYEE (  … ,          Dno               INT                  NOT NULL          DEFAULT  1, CONSTRAINT  EMPPK PRIMARY KEY  (Ssn), CONSTRAINT  EMPSUPERFK FOREIGN KEY  (Super_ssn) REFERENCES  EMPLOYEE(Ssn) ON DELETE  SET NULL              ON UPDATE  CASCADE, CONSTRAINT  EMPDEPTFK FOREIGN KEY (Dno) REFERENCES  DEPARTMENT(Dnumber) ON DELETE  SET DEFAULT       ON UPDATE  CASCADE); CREATE TABLE  DEPARTMENT (  … ,          Mgr_ssn CHAR(9)               NOT NULL           DEFAULT  ‘888665555’, … ,       CONSTRAINT  DEPTPK PRIMARY KEY (Dnumber), CONSTRAINT  DEPTSK UNIQUE  (Dname), CONSTRAINT  DEPTMGRFK FOREIGN KEY  (Mgr_ssn) REFERENCES  EMPLOYEE(Ssn) ON DELETE  SET DEFAULT       ON UPDATE  CASCADE); CREATE TABLE  DEPT_LOCATIONS (  … ,       PRIMARY KEY  (Dnumber, Dlocation), FOREIGN KEY  (Dnumber) REFERENCES  DEPARTMENT(Dnumber) ON DELETE  CASCADE                ON UPDATE  CASCADE);Figure 6.2 Example illustrating how default attribute values and referential integrity triggered actions are specified  in SQL.186 Chapter 6 Basic SQL We can then use the created domain D_NUM  as the attribute type for all attributes that refer to department numbers in Figure 6.1, such as Dnumber  of DEPARTMENT , Dnum  of PROJECT , Dno of EMPLOYEE , and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.2.2 Specifying Key and Referential Integrity Constraints Because keys and referential integrity constraints are very important, there are spe-cial clauses within the CREATE TABLE  statement to specify them. Some examples to illustrate the specification of keys and referential integrity are shown in Figure 6.1.7 The PRIMARY KEY  clause specifies one or more attributes that make up the primary key of a relation. If a primary key has a single  attribute, the clause can follow the attribute directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the primary key of DEPARTMENT  can be specified as follows (instead of the way it is specified in Figure 6.1): Dnumber INT PRIMARY KEY , The UNIQUE  clause specifies alternate (unique) keys, also known as candidate keys as illustrated in the DEPARTMENT  and PROJECT  table declarations in Figure 6.1.\n",
      "\n",
      "The UNIQUE  clause can also be specified directly for a unique key if it is a single attribute, as in the following example: Dname VARCHAR(15) UNIQUE , Referential integrity is specified via the FOREIGN KEY  clause, as shown in Fig- ure 6.1. As we discussed in Section 5.2.4, a referential integrity constraint can be violated when tuples are inserted or deleted, or when a foreign key or primary key attribute value is updated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The default action that SQL takes for an integrity viola-tion is to reject  the update operation that will cause a violation, which is known as the RESTRICT  option. However, the schema designer can specify an alternative action to be taken by attaching a referential triggered action  clause to any foreign key constraint. The options include SET NULL , CASCADE , and SET DEFAULT . An option must be qualified with either ON DELETE  or ON UPDATE . We illustrate this with the examples shown in Figure 6.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, the database designer chooses ON DELETE SET NULL  and ON UPDATE CASCADE  for the foreign key Super_ssn  of EMPLOYEE . This means that if the tuple for a supervising employee  is deleted , the value of Super_ssn  is automatically set to NULL  for all employee tuples that were referencing the deleted employee tuple.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, if the Ssn value for a supervising employee is updated  (say, because it was entered incorrectly), the new value is cascaded  to Super_ssn  for all employee tuples referencing the updated employee tuple.8 In general, the action taken by the DBMS for SET NULL  or SET DEFAULT  is the same for both ON DELETE  and ON UPDATE : The value of the affected referencing attributes is changed to NULL  for SET NULL  and to the specified default value of the 7Key and referential integrity constraints were not included in early versions of SQL.\n",
      "\n",
      "8Notice that the foreign key Super_ssn in the EMPLOYEE table is a circular reference and hence may have to be added later as a named constraint using the AL TER TABLE statement as we discussed at the end of Section 6.1.2. 6.3 Basic Retrieval Queries in SQL  187 referencing attribute for SET DEFAULT .\n",
      "\n",
      "The action for CASCADE ON DELETE  is to delete all the referencing tuples, whereas the action for CASCADE ON UPDATE  is to change the value of the referencing foreign key attribute(s) to the updated (new) primary key value for all the referencing tuples. It is the responsibility of the data-base designer to choose the appropriate action and to specify it in the database schema.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a general rule, the CASCADE  option is suitable for “relationship” rela- tions (see Section 9.1) , such as WORKS_ON ; for relations that represent multival- ued attributes, such as DEPT_LOCATIONS ; and for relations that represent weak entity types, such as DEPENDENT .\n",
      "\n",
      "6.2.3 Giving Names to Constraints Figure 6.2 also illustrates how a constraint may be given a constraint name , follow- ing the keyword CONSTRAINT . The names of all constraints within a particular schema must be unique. A constraint name is used to identify a particular con-straint in case the constraint must be dropped later and replaced with another con-straint, as we discuss in Chapter 7. Giving names to constraints is optional.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also possible to temporarily defer  a constraint until the end of a transaction, as we shall discuss in Chapter 20 when we present transaction concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.2.4 Specifying Constraints on Tuples Using CHECK In addition to key and referential integrity constraints, which are specified by spe-cial keywords, other table constraints  can be specified through additional CHECK clauses at the end of a CREATE TABLE  statement. These can be called row-based constraints because they apply to each row individually  and are checked whenever a row is inserted or modified. For example, suppose that the DEPARTMENT  table in Figure 6.1 had an additional attribute Dept_create_date , which stores the date when the department was created.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we could add the following CHECK  clause at the end of the CREATE TABLE  statement for the DEPARTMENT  table to make sure that a manager’s start date is later than the department creation date. CHECK  (Dept_create_date <= Mgr_start_date ); The CHECK  clause can also be used to specify more general constraints using the CREATE ASSERTION  statement of SQL. We discuss this in Chapter 7 because it requires the full power of queries, which are discussed in Sections 6.3 and 7.1.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.3 Basic Retrieval Queries in SQL   SQL has one basic statement for retrieving information from a database: the SELECT  statement. The SELECT  statement is not the same as  the SELECT  operation of relational algebra, which we shall discuss in Chapter 8. There are many options and flavors to the SELECT  statement in SQL, so we will introduce its features grad- ually.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will use example queries specified on the schema of Figure 5.5 and will 188 Chapter 6 Basic SQL refer to the sample database state shown in Figure 5.6 to show the results of some of these queries. In this section, we present the features of SQL for simple retrieval queries . Features of SQL for specifying more complex retrieval queries are pre- sented in Section 7.1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before proceeding, we must point out an important distinction  between the practical SQL model and the formal relational model discussed in Chapter 5: SQL allows a table (relation) to have two or more tuples that are identical in all their attribute values. Hence, in general, an SQL  table is not a set of tuples , because a set does not allow two identical members; rather, it is a multiset  (sometimes called a bag) of tuples.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some SQL relations are constrained to be sets  because a key constraint has been declared or because the DISTINCT  option has been used with the SELECT  state- ment (described later in this section). We should be aware of this distinction as we discuss the examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.3.1  The SELECT-FROM-WHERE Structure of Basic SQL Queries Queries in SQL can be very complex. We will start with simple queries, and then progress to more complex ones in a step-by-step manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic form of the SELECT  statement, sometimes called a mapping  or a select-from-where block , is formed of the three clauses SELECT , FROM , and WHERE  and has the following form:9 SELECT  <attribute list> FROM  <table list> WHERE  <condition>; where ■<attribute list> is a list of attribute names whose values are to be retrieved by the query. ■<table list> is a list of the relation names required to process the query.\n",
      "\n",
      "■<condition> is a conditional (Boolean) expression that identifies the tuples to be retrieved by the query. In SQL, the basic logical comparison operators for comparing attribute values with one another and with literal constants are =, <, <=, >, >=, and <>. These correspond to the relational algebra operators =, <, ≤, >, ≥, and ≠, respectively, and to the C/C++ programming language operators =, <, <=, >, >=, and !=. The main syntactic difference is the not equal  operator.\n",
      "\n",
      "SQL has additional comparison operators that we will present gradually. We illustrate the basic SELECT  statement in SQL with some sample queries. The queries are labeled here with the same query numbers used in Chapter 8 for easy cross-reference. 9The SELECT and FROM clauses are required in all SQL queries. The W HERE is optional (see Sec- tion 6.3.3). 6.3 Basic Retrieval Queries in SQL  189 Query 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "Retrieve the birth date and address of the employee(s) whose name is ‘John B. Smith’. Q0: SELECT  Bdate, Address FROM  EMPLOYEE WHERE  Fname = ‘John’  AND  Minit = ‘B’ AND  Lname = ‘Smith’; This query involves only the EMPLOYEE  relation listed in the FROM  clause.\n",
      "\n",
      "The query selects  the individual EMPLOYEE  tuples that satisfy the condition of the WHERE  clause, then projects  the result on the Bdate  and Address  attributes listed in the SELECT  clause. The SELECT  clause of SQL specifies the attributes whose values are to be retrieved, which are called the projection attributes  in relational algebra (see Chapter 8) and the WHERE  clause specifies the Boolean condition that must be true for any retrieved tuple, which is known as the selection condition  in relational algebra .\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 6.3(a) shows the result of query Q0 on the database of Figure 5.6. We can think of an implicit tuple variable  or iterator  in the SQL query ranging or looping  over each individual tuple in the EMPLOYEE  table and evaluating the condi- tion in the WHERE  clause. Only those tuples that satisfy the condition—that is, those tuples for which the condition evaluates to TRUE  after substituting their cor- responding attribute values—are selected. Query 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Retrieve the name and address of all employees who work for the ‘Research’ department. Q1: SELECT  Fname, Lname, Address FROM  EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT WHERE  Dname = ‘Research’  AND  Dnumber = Dno; In the WHERE  clause of Q1, the condition Dname  = ‘Research’ is a selection condition that chooses the particular tuple of interest in the DEPARTMENT  table, because Dname is an attribute of DEPARTMENT .\n",
      "\n",
      "The condition Dnumber  = Dno is called a join condition , because it combines two tuples: one from DEPARTMENT  and one from EMPLOYEE , whenever the value of Dnumber  in DEPARTMENT  is equal to the value of Dno in EMPLOYEE . The result of query Q1 is shown in Figure 6.3(b). In general, any number of selection and join conditions may be specified in a single SQL query. A query that involves only selection and join conditions plus projection attributes is known as a select-project-join  query.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next example is a select-project-join query with two join conditions. Query 2. For every project located in ‘Stafford’, list the project number, the controlling department number, and the department manager’s last name, address, and birth date.\n",

      "Q2: SELECT  Pnumber, Dnum, Lname, Address, Bdate FROM  PROJECT, DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE WHERE   Dnum = Dnumber AND  Mgr_ssn = Ssn AND   The join condition Dnum  = Dnumber  relates a project tuple to its controlling depart- ment tuple, whereas the join condition Mgr_ssn  = Ssn relates the controlling depart- ment tuple to the employee tuple who manages that department.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each tuple in the result will be a combination  of one project, one department (that controls the proj- ect), and one employee (that manages the department). The projection attributes are used to choose the attributes to be displayed from each combined tuple. The result of query Q2 is shown in Figure 6.3(c).\n",
      "\n",
      "6.3.2  Ambiguous Attribute Names, Aliasing, Renaming, and Tuple Variables In SQL, the same name can be used for two (or more) attributes as long as the attributes are in different tables. If this is the case, and a multitable query refers to two or more attributes with the same name, we must  qualify  the attribute name with the relation name to prevent ambiguity. This is done by prefixing  the rela- tion name to the attribute name and separating the two by a period.\n",
      "\n",
      "To illustrate this, suppose that in Figures 5.5 and 5.6 the Dno and Lname  attributes of the EMPLOYEE  relation were called Dnumber  and Name , and the Dname  attribute of DEPARTMENT  was also called Name ; then, to prevent ambiguity, query Q1 would be rephrased as shown in Q1A .\n",
      "\n",
      "We must prefix the attributes Name  and Dnumber in Q1A  to specify which ones we are referring to, because the same attribute names are used in both relations: Q1A:  SELECT  Fname, EMPLOYEE.Name, Address FROM  EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT WHERE   DEPARTMENT.Name = ‘Research’  AND DEPARTMENT.Dnumber = EMPLOYEE.Dnumber; Fully qualified attribute names can be used for clarity even if there is no ambi- guity in attribute names.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1 can be rewritten as Q1′ below with fully qualified attribute names. We can also rename the table names to shorter names by creat- ing an alias  for each table name to avoid repeated typing of long table names (see Q8 below).\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1′: SELECT   EMPLOYEE.Fname, EMPLOYEE.LName, EMPLOYEE.Address FROM  EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT WHERE   DEPARTMENT.DName = ‘Research’  AND DEPARTMENT.Dnumber = EMPLOYEE.Dno; The ambiguity of attribute names also arises in the case of queries that refer to the same relation twice, as in the following example. Query 8.\n",
      "\n",
      "For each employee, retrieve the employee’s first and last name and the first and last name of his or her immediate supervisor. Q8: SELECT  E.Fname, E.Lname, S.Fname, S.Lname FROM  EMPLOYEE AS E, EMPLOYEE AS S WHERE  E.Super_ssn = S.Ssn;192 Chapter 6 Basic SQL In this case, we are required to declare alternative relation names E and S, called aliases  or tuple variables , for the EMPLOYEE  relation.\n",
      "\n",
      "An alias can follow the key- word AS, as shown in Q8, or it can directly follow the relation name—for example, by writing EMPLOYEE E , EMPLOYEE S  in the FROM  clause of Q8. It is also possible to rename  the relation attributes within the query in SQL by giving them aliases.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if we write EMPLOYEE AS E(Fn, Mi, Ln, Ssn, Bd, Addr, Sex, Sal, Sssn, Dno) in the FROM  clause, Fn becomes an alias for Fname , Mi for Minit , Ln for Lname , and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Q8, we can think of E and S as two different copies  of the EMPLOYEE  relation; the first, E, represents employees in the role of supervisees or subordinates; the second, S, represents employees in the role of supervisors. We can now join the two copies. Of course, in reality there is only one  EMPLOYEE  relation, and the join condition is meant to join the relation with itself by matching the tuples that satisfy the join condition E.Super_ssn  = S.Ssn .\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that this is an example of a one-level recur- sive query, as we will discuss in Section 8.4.2. In earlier versions of SQL, it was not possible to specify a general recursive query, with an unknown number of levels, in a single SQL statement. A construct for specifying recursive queries has been incor- porated into SQL:1999 (see Chapter 7). The result of query Q8 is shown in Figure 6.3(d).\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever one or more aliases are given to a relation, we can use these names to represent different references to that same relation. This permits multiple references to the same relation within a query. We can use this alias-naming or renaming  mechanism in any SQL query to specify tuple variables for every table in the WHERE  clause, whether or not the same rela- tion needs to be referenced more than once. In fact, this practice is recommended since it results in queries that are easier to comprehend.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we could specify query Q1 as in Q1B : Q1B:  SELECT  E.Fname, E.LName, E.Address FROM  EMPLOYEE AS E, DEPARTMENT AS D WHERE  D.DName = ‘Research’  AND  D.Dnumber = E.Dno;\n",
      "\n",
      "6.3.3 Unspecified WHERE Clause and Use of the Asterisk We discuss two more features of SQL here. A missing  WHERE  clause indicates no condition on tuple selection; hence, all tuples  of the relation specified in the FROM  clause qualify and are selected for the query result. If more than one rela- tion is specified in the FROM  clause and there is no WHERE  clause, then the CROSS PRODUCT —all possible tuple combinations —of these relations is selected.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, Query 9 selects all EMPLOYEE  Ssns (Figure 6.3(e)), and Query 10 selects all combinations of an EMPLOYEE  Ssn and a DEPARTMENT Dname , regardless of whether the employee works for the department or not (Figure 6.3(f)). 6.3 Basic Retrieval Queries in SQL  193 Queries 9 and 10.\n",

Q9: SELECT  Ssn FROM  EMPLOYEE; Q10:  SELECT  Ssn, Dname FROM  EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT; It is extremely important to specify every selection and join condition in the WHERE clause; if any such condition is overlooked, incorrect and very large relations may result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that Q10  is similar to a CROSS PRODUCT  operation followed by a PROJECT  operation in relational algebra (see Chapter 8). If we specify all the attri- butes of EMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT  in Q10, we get the actual CROSS PRODUCT (except for duplicate elimination, if any). To retrieve all the attribute values of the selected tuples, we do not have to list the attribute names explicitly in SQL; we just specify an asterisk  (*), which stands for all the attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The * can also be prefixed by the relation name or alias; for example, EMPLOYEE. * refers to all attributes of the EMPLOYEE table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Query Q1C  retrieves all the attribute values of any EMPLOYEE  who works in DEPARTMENT  number 5 (Figure 6.3(g)), query Q1D  retrieves all the attributes of an EMPLOYEE  and the attributes of the DEPARTMENT  in which he or she works for every employee of the ‘Research’ department, and Q10A  specifies the CROSS PRODUCT of the EMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT  relations.\n",

      "\n",
      "6.3.4 Tables as Sets in SQL As we mentioned earlier, SQL usually treats a table not as a set but rather as a multiset ; duplicate tuples can appear more than once  in a table, and in the result of a query. SQL does not automatically eliminate duplicate tuples in the results of queries, for the following reasons: ■Duplicate elimination is an expensive operation. One way to implement it is to sort the tuples first and then eliminate duplicates. ■The user may want to see duplicate tuples in the result of a query.\n",
      "\n",
      "■When an aggregate function (see Section 7.1.7) is applied to tuples, in most cases we do not want to eliminate duplicates.194 Chapter 6 Basic SQL An SQL table with a key is restricted to being a set, since the key value must be dis- tinct in each tuple.10 If we do want  to eliminate duplicate tuples from the result of an SQL query, we use the keyword DISTINCT  in the SELECT  clause, meaning that only distinct tuples should remain in the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, a query with SELECT DISTINCT  eliminates duplicates, whereas a query with SELECT ALL  does not. Speci- fying SELECT  with neither ALL nor DISTINCT —as in our previous examples—is equivalent to SELECT ALL . For example, Q11 retrieves the salary of every employee; if several employees have the same salary, that salary value will appear as many times in the result of the query, as shown in Figure 6.4(a).\n",
      "\n",
      "If we are interested only in distinct salary values, we want each value to appear only once, regardless of how many employees earn that salary.

The first feature allows comparison conditions on only parts of a character string, using the LIKE  compari- son operator. This can be used for string pattern matching .

      "Q12:  SELECT  Fname, Lname FROM  EMPLOYEE WHERE  Bdate LIKE  ‘_ _ 7 _ _ _ _ _ _ _’; If an underscore or % is needed as a literal character in the string, the character should be preceded by an escape character , which is specified after the string using the keyword ESCAPE . For example, ‘AB\\_CD\\%EF’ ESCAPE  ‘\\’ represents the lit- eral string ‘AB_CD%EF’ because \\ is specified as the escape character.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any charac- ter not used in the string can be chosen as the escape character. Also, we need a rule to specify apostrophes or single quotation marks (‘ ’) if they are to be included in a string because they are used to begin and end strings. If an apostrophe (’) is needed, it is represented as two consecutive apostrophes (”) so that it will not be interpreted as ending the string.\n",

      "\n",
      "6.4.1 The INSERT Command In its simplest form, INSERT  is used to add a single tuple (row) to a relation (table). We must specify the relation name and a list of values for the tuple. The values should be listed in the same order  in which the corresponding attributes were speci- fied in the CREATE TABLE  command.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, to add a new tuple to the EMPLOYEE  relation shown in Figure 5.5 and specified in the CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE  … command in Figure 6.1, we can use U1: U1: INSERT INTO  EMPLOYEE VALUES   ( ‘Richard’, ‘K’, ‘Marini’, ‘653298653’, ‘1962-12-30’, ‘98 Oak Forest, Katy, TX’, ‘M’, 37000, ‘653298653’, 4 ); A second form of the INSERT  statement allows the user to specify explicit attribute names that correspond to the values provided in the INSERT  command.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is use- ful if a relation has many attributes but only a few of those attributes are assigned values in the new tuple. However, the values must include all attributes with NOT NULL  specification and no default value. Attributes with NULL  allowed or DEFAULT values are the ones that can be left out.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, to enter a tuple for a new EMPLOYEE  for whom we know only the Fname , Lname , Dno, and Ssn attributes, we can use U1A: U1A:  INSERT INTO  EMPLOYEE (Fname, Lname, Dno, Ssn) VALUES  (‘Richard’, ‘Marini’, 4, ‘653298653’); Attributes not specified in U1A are set to their DEFAULT  or to NULL , and the values are listed in the same order as the attributes are listed in the INSERT  command itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also possible to insert into a relation multiple tuples  separated by commas in a single INSERT  command. The attribute values forming each tuple  are enclosed in parentheses. 6.4 INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE Statements in SQL  199 A DBMS that fully implements SQL should support and enforce all the integrity constraints that can be specified in the DDL.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if we issue the command in U2 on the database shown in Figure 5.6, the DBMS should reject  the operation because no DEPARTMENT  tuple exists in the database with Dnumber  = 2. Similarly, U2A would be rejected  because no Ssn value is provided and it is the primary key, which cannot be NULL .\n",

      "A variation of the INSERT  command inserts multiple tuples into a relation in con- junction with creating the relation and loading it with the result of a query.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, to create a temporary table that has the employee last name, project name, and hours per week for each employee working on a project, we can write the state-ments in U3A and U3B: U3A:  CREATE TABLE  WORKS_ON_INFO ( Emp_name  VARCHAR (15), Proj_name  VARCHAR (15), Hours_per_week DECIMAL (3,1) ); U3B:  INSERT INTO   WORKS_ON_INFO ( Emp_name, Proj_name, Hours_per_week ) SELECT   E.Lname, P.Pname, W.Hours FROM   PROJECT P, WORKS_ON W, EMPLOYEE E WHERE   P.Pnumber = W.Pno AND  W.Essn = E.Ssn; A table WORKS_ON_INFO  is created by U3A and is loaded with the joined informa- tion retrieved from the database by the query in U3B .\n",

      "\n",
      "We have to create a view (see Chap- ter 7) to keep such a table up to date. Most DBMSs have bulk loading  tools that allow a user to load formatted data from a file into a table without having to write a large number of INSERT commands. The user can also write a program to read each record in the file, format it as a row in the table, and insert it using the looping constructs of a programming language (see Chapters 10 and 11, where we discuss database programming techniques).\n",
      "\n",
      "Another variation for loading data is to create a new table TNEW that has the same attributes as an existing table T, and load some of the data currently in T into TNEW. The syntax for doing this uses the LIKE clause.\n",

      "For example, if we 200 Chapter 6 Basic SQL want to create a table D5EMPS with a similar structure to the EMPLOYEE table and load it with the rows of employees who work in department 5, we can write the following SQL: CREATE TABLE  D5EMPS LIKE  EMPLOYEE (SELECT   E.* FROM   EMPLOYEE AS E WHERE   E.Dno = 5) WITH DATA ; The clause WITH DATA specifies that the table will be created and loaded with the data specified in the query, although in some implementations it may be left out.\n",

      "6.4.2 The DELETE Command The DELETE  command removes tuples from a relation. It includes a WHERE clause, similar to that used in an SQL query, to select the tuples to be deleted. Tuples are explicitly deleted from only one table at a time. However, the deletion may propagate to tuples in other relations if referential triggered actions  are spec- ified in the referential integrity constraints of the DDL (see Section 6.2.2).\n",
      "\n",
      "12 Depending on the number of tuples selected by the condition in the WHERE clause, zero, one, or several tuples can be deleted by a single DELETE  command. A missing WHERE  clause specifies that all tuples in the relation are to be deleted; however, the table remains in the database as an empty table. We must use the DROP TABLE  command to remove the table definition (see Chapter 7).\n",

      "\n",
      "6.4.3 The UPDATE Command The UPDATE  command is used to modify attribute values of one or more selected tuples. As in the DELETE  command, a WHERE  clause in the UPDATE  command selects the tuples to be modified from a single relation. However, updating a pri-mary key value may propagate to the foreign key values of tuples in other rela-tions if such a referential triggered action  is specified in the referential integrity 12Other actions can be automatically applied through triggers (see Section 26.1) and other mechanisms.\n",

We discuss these techniques in Chapter 10. We also describe how to access SQL databases through the Java programming language using JDBC and SQLJ.\n",

      "\n",
      " In Section 6.3, we described some basic types of retrieval queries in SQL. Because of the generality and expressive power of the language, there are many additional fea-tures that allow users to specify more complex retrievals from the database. We discuss several of these features in this section.chapter  7208 Chapter 7 More SQL: Complex Queries, Triggers, Views, and Schema Modification\n",
      "\n",
      "7.1.1 Comparisons Involving NULL and Three-Valued Logic SQL has various rules for dealing with NULL  values. Recall from Section 5.1.2 that NULL  is used to represent a missing value, but that it usually has one of three differ- ent interpretations—value unknown  (value exists but is not known, or it is not known whether or not the value exists), value not available  (value exists but is pur- posely withheld), or value not applicable  (the attribute does not apply to this tuple or is undefined for this tuple).\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider the following examples to illustrate each of the meanings of NULL . 1. Unknown value. A person’s date of birth is not known, so it is represented by NULL  in the database. An example of the other case of unknown would be NULL  for a person’s home phone because it is not known whether or not the person has a home phone. 2. Unavailable or withheld value. A person has a home phone but does not want it to be listed, so it is withheld and represented as NULL  in the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Not applicable attribute. An attribute LastCollegeDegree would be NULL  for a person who has no college degrees because it does not apply to that person. It is often not possible to determine which of the meanings is intended; for exam- ple, a NULL  for the home phone of a person can have any of the three meanings. Hence, SQL does not distinguish among the different meanings of NULL . In general, each individual NULL  value is considered to be different from every other NULL  value in the various database records.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a record with NULL  in one of its attributes is involved in a comparison operation, the result is considered to be UNKNOWN  (it may be TRUE  or it may be FALSE ). Hence, SQL uses a three-valued logic with values TRUE , FALSE , and UNKNOWN  instead of the standard two-valued (Boolean) logic with values TRUE  or FALSE . It is therefore necessary to define the results (or truth values) of three-valued logical expressions when the logical con-nectives AND , OR, and NOT are used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Table 7.1 shows the resulting values.\n",

      "\n",
      "Each expression result would have a value of TRUE , FALSE , or UNKNOWN . The result of combining the two values using the AND  logical connec- tive is shown by the entries in Table 7.1(a). Table 7.1(b) shows the result of using the OR logical connective. For example, the result of ( FALSE AND UNKNOWN ) is FALSE , whereas the result of ( FALSE OR UNKNOWN ) is UNKNOWN . Table 7.1(c) shows the result of the NOT  logical operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that in standard Boolean logic, only TRUE  or FALSE  values are permitted; there is no UNKNOWN  value. In select-project-join queries, the general rule is that only those combinations of tuples that evaluate the logical expression in the WHERE  clause of the query to TRUE are selected. Tuple combinations that evaluate to FALSE  or UNKNOWN  are not selected. However, there are exceptions to that rule for certain operations, such as outer joins, as we shall see in Section 7.1.6. SQL allows queries that check whether an attribute value is NULL .\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather than using = or <> to compare an attribute value to NULL , SQL uses the comparison operators IS or IS NOT . This is because SQL considers each NULL  value as being distinct from every other NULL  value, so equality comparison is not appropriate. It follows that when a join condition is specified, tuples with NULL  values for the join attributes are not included in the result (unless it is an OUTER JOIN ; see Section 7.1.6). Query 18 illustrates NULL  com- parison by retrieving any employees who do not have a supervisor.\n",

Such queries can be conveniently formulated by using nested queries , which are complete select-from-where blocks within another SQL query. That other query is called the outer query . These nested queries can also appear in the WHERE clause or the FROM clause or the SELECT clause or other SQL clauses as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Query 4 is formulated in Q4 without a nested query, but it can be rephrased to use nested queries as shown in Q4A .\n",
      "\n",
      "Q4A  introduces the com- parison operator IN, which compares a value v with a set (or multiset) of values V and evaluates to TRUE  if v is one of the elements in V. In Q4A, the first nested query selects the project numbers of projects that have an employee with last name ‘Smith’ involved as manager, whereas the second nested query selects the project numbers of projects that have an employee with last name ‘Smith’ involved as worker.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the outer query, we use the OR logical connective to retrieve a PROJECT  tuple if the PNUMBER  value of that tuple is in the result of either nested query.210 Chapter 7 More SQL: Complex Queries, Triggers, Views, and Schema Modification Q4A:  SELECT  DISTINCT  Pnumber FROM  PROJECT WHERE  Pnumber IN ( SELECT  Pnumber FROM  PROJECT, DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE WHERE   Dnum = Dnumber  AND Mgr_ssn = Ssn  AND  Lname = ‘Smith’ ) OR Pnumber  IN ( SELECT  Pno FROM  WORKS_ON, EMPLOYEE WHERE  Essn = Ssn  AND  Lname = ‘Smith’ ); If a nested query returns a single attribute and a single tuple, the query result will be a single ( scalar ) value.\n",
      "\n",
      "In such cases, it is permissible to use = instead of IN for the comparison operator. In general, the nested query will return a table  (relation), which is a set or multiset of tuples. SQL allows the use of tuples  of values in comparisons by placing them within parentheses.\n",
      "\n",
      "To illustrate this, consider the following query: SELECT  DISTINCT  Essn FROM  WORKS_ON WHERE  ( Pno, Hours ) IN ( SELECT  Pno, Hours FROM  WORKS_ON WHERE  Essn = ‘123456789’ ); This query will select the Essns  of all employees who work the same (project, hours) combination on some project that employee ‘John Smith’ (whose Ssn = ‘123456789’) works on.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, the IN operator compares the subtuple of values in paren- theses ( Pno, Hours ) within each tuple in WORKS_ON  with the set of type-compatible tuples produced by the nested query. In addition to the IN operator, a number of other comparison operators can be used to compare a single value v (typically an attribute name) to a set or multiset v (typi- cally a nested query).\n",
      "\n",
      "The = ANY (or = SOME ) operator returns TRUE  if the value v is equal to some value  in the set V and is hence equivalent to IN. The two keywords ANY and SOME  have the same effect. Other operators that can be combined with ANY (or SOME ) include >, >=, <, <=, and <>. The keyword ALL can also be com- bined with each of these operators.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the comparison condition ( v > ALL V) returns TRUE  if the value v is greater than all the values in the set (or multiset) V. An example is the following query, which returns the names of employees whose salary is greater than the salary of all the employees in department 5: SELECT  Lname, Fname FROM  EMPLOYEE WHERE  Salary >  ALL ( SELECT  Salary FROM  EMPLOYEE WHERE  Dno = 5 ); 7.1 More Complex SQL Retrieval Queries  211 Notice that this query can also be specified using the MAX  aggregate function (see Section 7.1.7).\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, we can have several levels of nested queries. We can once again be faced with possible ambiguity among attribute names if attributes of the same name exist—one in a relation in the FROM  clause of the outer query,  and another in a rela- tion in the FROM  clause of the nested query. The rule is that a reference to an unqualified attribute  refers to the relation declared in the innermost nested query .\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in the SELECT  clause and WHERE  clause of the first nested query of Q4A , a reference to any unqualified attribute of the PROJECT  relation refers to the PROJECT  relation specified in the FROM  clause of the nested query. To refer to an attribute of the PROJECT  relation specified in the outer query, we specify and refer to an alias  (tuple variable) for that relation. These rules are similar to scope rules for program variables in most programming languages that allow nested procedures and functions.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "If there were any unqualified references to Sex in the nested query, they would refer to the Sex attribute of DEPENDENT . However, we would not have to qualify the attributes Fname  and Ssn of EMPLOYEE  if they appeared in the nested query because the DEPENDENT  relation does not have attributes called Fname  and Ssn, so there is no ambiguity. It is generally advisable to create tuple variables (aliases) for all the tables referenced in an SQL query  to avoid potential errors and ambiguities, as illustrated in Q16.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.1.3 Correlated Nested Queries Whenever a condition in the WHERE  clause of a nested query references some attri- bute of a relation declared in the outer query, the two queries are said to be correlated . We can understand a correlated query better by considering that the nested query is evaluated once for each tuple (or combination of tuples) in the outer query.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we can think of Q16 as follows: For each  EMPLOYEE  tuple, evaluate the nested query, which retrieves the Essn  values for all DEPENDENT  tuples with the same sex and name as that EMPLOYEE  tuple; if the Ssn value of the EMPLOYEE  tuple is in the result of the nested query, then select that EMPLOYEE  tuple.212 Chapter 7 More SQL: Complex Queries, Triggers, Views, and Schema Modification In general, a query written with nested select-from-where blocks and using the = or IN comparison operators can always  be expressed as a single block query.\n",

The EXISTS  function in SQL is used to check whether the result of a nested query is empty  (contains no tuples) or not. The result of EXISTS  is a Boolean value TRUE  if the nested query result contains at least one tuple, or FALSE  if the nested query result contains no tuples.

Retrieve the Social Security numbers of all employees who work on project numbers 1, 2, or 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q17:  SELECT  DISTINCT  Essn FROM  WORKS_ON WHERE  Pno IN (1, 2, 3); In SQL, it is possible to rename  any attribute that appears in the result of a query by adding the qualifier AS followed by the desired new name. Hence, the AS con- struct can be used to alias both attribute and relation names in general, and it can be used in appropriate parts of a query.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, Q8A  shows how query Q8 from Section 4.3.2 can be slightly changed to retrieve the last name of each employee and his or her supervisor while renaming the resulting attribute names  7.1 More Complex SQL Retrieval Queries  215 as Employee_name  and Supervisor_name . The new names will appear as column headers for the query result.\n",

      "7.1.6 Joined Tables in SQL and Outer Joins The concept of a joined table  (or joined relation ) was incorporated into SQL to permit users to specify a table resulting from a join operation in the  FROM  clause  of a query. This construct may be easier to comprehend than mixing together all the select and join conditions in the WHERE  clause. For example, consider query Q1, which retrieves the name and address of every employee who works for the ‘Research’ department.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be easier to specify the join of the EMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT relations in the WHERE clause, and then to select the desired tuples and attributes. This can be written in SQL as in Q1A : Q1A:  SELECT  Fname, Lname, Address FROM  (EMPLOYEE  JOIN  DEPARTMENT  ON Dno = Dnumber) WHERE  Dname = ‘Research’; The FROM  clause in Q1A  contains a single joined table.\n",
      "\n",
      "The attributes of such a table are all the attributes of the first table, EMPLOYEE , followed by all the attributes of the second table, DEPARTMENT . The concept of a joined table also allows the user to specify different types of join, such as NATURAL JOIN  and various types of OUTER JOIN . In a NATURAL JOIN  on two relations R and S, no join condition is specified; an implicit EQUIJOIN  condition  for each pair of attributes with the same name  from R and S is created.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each such pair of attributes is included only once  in the resulting relation (see Sections 8.3.2 and 8.4.4 for more details on the various types of join operations in relational algebra). If the names of the join attributes are not the same in the base relations, it is possible to rename the attributes so that they match, and then to apply NATURAL JOIN . In this case, the AS construct can be used to rename a relation and all its attributes in the FROM  clause.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is illustrated in Q1B , where the DEPARTMENT  relation is renamed as DEPT  and its attributes are renamed as Dname , Dno (to match the name of the desired join attribute Dno in the EMPLOYEE  table), Mssn , and Msdate .\n",
      "\n",
      "The implied join condition for this NATURAL JOIN  is EMPLOYEE.Dno  = DEPT.Dno , because this is the only pair of attributes with the same name after renaming: Q1B:  SELECT  Fname, Lname, Address FROM  (EMPLOYEE  NATURAL JOIN (DEPARTMENT  AS DEPT (Dname, Dno, Mssn, Msdate))) WHERE  Dname = ‘Research’ ; The default type of join in a joined table is called an inner join , where a tuple is included in the result only if a matching tuple exists in the other relation.\n",
      "\n",
      "For exam- ple, in query Q8A , only employees who have a supervisor  are included in the result; 216 Chapter 7 More SQL: Complex Queries, Triggers, Views, and Schema Modification an EMPLOYEE  tuple whose value for Super_ssn  is NULL  is excluded. If the user requires that all employees be included, a different type of join called OUTER JOIN must be used explicitly (see Section 8.4.4 for the definition of OUTER JOIN in rela- tional algebra ).\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several variations of OUTER JOIN, as we shall see.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the SQL standard, this is handled by explicitly specifying the keyword OUTER JOIN  in a joined table, as illustrated in Q8B : Q8B:  SELECT  E.Lname  AS Employee_name, S.Lname  AS Supervisor_name FROM  (EMPLOYEE  AS E LEFT OUTER JOIN  EMPLOYEE  AS S ON E.Super_ssn = S.Ssn); In SQL, the options available for specifying joined tables include INNER JOIN  (only pairs of tuples that match the join condition are retrieved, same as JOIN ), LEFT OUTER JOIN  (every tuple in the left table must appear in the result; if it does not have a matching tuple, it is padded with NULL  values for the attributes of the right table), RIGHT OUTER JOIN  (every tuple in the right table must appear in the result; if it does not have a matching tuple, it is padded with NULL  values for the attributes of the left table), and FULL OUTER JOIN .\n",
      "\n",
      "In the latter three options, the keyword OUTER  may be omitted. If the join attributes have the same name, one can also specify the natural join variation of outer joins by using the keyword NATURAL  before the operation (for example, NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN ). The keyword CROSS JOIN  is used to specify the CARTESIAN PRODUCT  operation (see Section 8.2.2), although this should be used only with the utmost care because it generates all possible tuple combinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also possible to nest join specifications; that is, one of the tables in a join may itself be a joined table. This allows the specification of the join of three or more tables as a single joined table, which is called a multiway join .\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, Q2A  is a differ- ent way of specifying query Q2 from Section 6.3.1 using the concept of a joined table: Q2A:  SELECT  Pnumber, Dnum, Lname, Address, Bdate FROM  ( (PROJECT  JOIN  DEPARTMENT  ON Dnum = Dnumber) JOIN  EMPLOYEE  ON Mgr_ssn = Ssn) WHERE  Plocation = ‘Stafford’ ; Not all SQL implementations have implemented the new syntax of joined tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some systems, a different syntax was used to specify outer joins by using the compari-son operators + =, = +, and + = + for left, right, and full outer join, respectively, when specifying the join condition. For example, this syntax is available in Oracle.\n",
      "\n",
      "To specify the left outer join in Q8B  using this syntax, we could write the query Q8C  as follows: Q8C:  SELECT  E.Lname, S.Lname FROM  EMPLOYEE E, EMPLOYEE S WHERE  E.Super_ssn + = S.Ssn;\n",

      "7.1.7 Aggregate Functions in SQL Aggregate functions  are used to summarize information from multiple tuples into a single-tuple summary. Grouping  is used to create subgroups of tuples before summarization. Grouping and aggregation are required in many database  7.1 More Complex SQL Retrieval Queries  217 applications, and we will introduce their use in SQL through examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "A number of built-in aggregate functions exist: COUNT , SUM , MAX , MIN, and AVG .2 The COUNT  function returns the number of tuples or values  as specified in a query. The functions SUM , MAX , MIN, and AVG  can be applied to a set or multiset of numeric values and return, respectively, the sum, maximum value, minimum value, and average (mean) of those values. These functions can be used in the SELECT  clause or in a HAVING  clause (which we introduce later).\n",
      "\n",
      "The functions MAX  and MIN can also be used with attributes that have nonnumeric domains if the domain values have a total ordering  among one another.3 We illustrate the use of these functions with several queries.

      "\n",
      "Query 20. Find the sum of the salaries of all employees of the ‘Research’ depart- ment, as well as the maximum salary, the minimum salary, and the average salary in this department.

      "\n",
      "3Total order means that for any two values in the domain, it can be determined that one appears before the other in the defined order; for example, DATE, TIME, and TIMESTAMP domains have total orderings on their values, as do alphabetic strings.218 Chapter 7 More SQL: Complex Queries, Triggers, Views, and Schema Modification Here the asterisk (*) refers to the rows  (tuples), so COUNT  (*) returns the number of rows in the result of the query.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may also use the COUNT  function to count val- ues in a column rather than tuples, as in the next example. Query 23. Count the number of distinct salary values in the database. Q23:  SELECT  COUNT  (DISTINCT  Salary) FROM  EMPLOYEE; If we write COUNT (SALARY ) instead of COUNT (DISTINCT SALARY ) in Q23 , then duplicate values will not be eliminated. However, any tuples with NULL  for SALARY will not be counted.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, NULL  values are discarded  when aggregate func- tions are applied to a particular column (attribute); the only exception is for COUNT(*) because tuples instead of values are counted. In the previous examples, any Salary values that are NULL are not included in the aggregate function calcula-tion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The general rule is as follows: when an aggregate function is applied to a col-lection of values, NULLs are removed from the collection before the calculation; if the collection becomes empty because all values are NULL, the aggregate function will return NULL (except in the case of COUNT, where it will return 0 for an empty collection of values). The preceding examples summarize a whole relation  ( Q19, Q21, Q23) or a selected subset of tuples ( Q20 , Q22 ), and hence all produce a table with a single row or a single value.\n",
      "\n",
      "They illustrate how functions are applied to retrieve a summary value or summary tuple from a table. These functions can also be used in selection condi- tions involving nested queries. We can specify a correlated nested query with an aggregate function, and then use the nested query in the WHERE  clause of an outer query.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, to retrieve the names of all employees who have two or more dependents (Query 5), we can write the following: Q5: SELECT  Lname, Fname FROM  EMPLOYEE WHERE  ( SELECT  COUNT  (*) FROM   DEPENDENT WHERE  Ssn = Essn  ) > =  2; The correlated nested query counts the number of dependents that each employee has; if this is greater than or equal to two, the employee tuple is selected.\n",
      "\n",
      "SQL also has aggregate functions SOME and ALL that can be applied to a col- lection of Boolean values; SOME returns TRUE if at least one element in the collection is TRUE, whereas ALL returns TRUE if all elements in the collection are TRUE.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.1.8 Grouping: The GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses In many cases we want to apply the aggregate functions to subgroups of tuples in a relation,  where the subgroups are based on some attribute values. For example, we may want to find the average salary of employees in each department  or the number  7.1 More Complex SQL Retrieval Queries  219 of employees who work on each project . In these cases we need to partition  the rela- tion into nonoverlapping subsets (or groups ) of tuples.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each group (partition) will consist of the tuples that have the same value of some attribute(s), called the  grouping attribute(s) . We can then apply the function to each such group indepen- dently to produce summary information about each group. SQL has a GROUP BY clause for this purpose. The GROUP BY  clause specifies the grouping attributes, which should also appear in the  SELECT  clause,  so that the value resulting from applying each aggregate function to a group of tuples appears along with the value of the grouping attribute(s).

Q24:  SELECT  Dno,  COUNT  (*), AVG  (Salary) FROM  EMPLOYEE GROUP BY  Dno; In Q24 , the EMPLOYEE  tuples are partitioned into groups—each group having the same value for the GROUP BY attribute Dno. Hence, each group contains the employees who work in the same department. The COUNT  and AVG  functions are applied to each such group of tuples.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that the SELECT  clause includes only the grouping attribute and the aggregate functions to be applied on each group of tuples. Figure 7.1(a) illustrates how grouping works and shows the result of Q24 . If NULL s exist in the grouping attribute, then a separate group  is created for all tuples with a NULL  value in the grouping attribute. For example, if the EMPLOYEE table had some tuples that had NULL  for the grouping attribute Dno, there would be a separate group for those tuples in the result of Q24.\n",

      "Sometimes we want to retrieve the values of these functions only for groups that satisfy certain conditions. For example, suppose that we want to modify Query 25 so that only projects with more than two employees appear in the result.

The WITH clause allows a user to define a table that will only be used in a particular query; it is some-what similar to creating a view (see Section 7.3) that will be used only in one query and then dropped. This construct was introduced as a convenience in SQL:99 and may not be available in all SQL based DBMSs. Queries using WITH can generally be written using other SQL constructs.\n",

      "\n",
      "Once this query is executed, the temporary table BIGDEPTS is discarded. SQL also has a CASE construct, which can be used when a value can be different based on certain conditions. This can be used in any part of an SQL query where a value is expected, including when querying, inserting or updating tuples. We illus-trate this with an example.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose we want to give employees different raise amounts depending on which department they work for; for example, employees in department 5 get a $2,000 raise, those in department 4 get $1,500 and those in department 1 get $3,000 (see Figure 5.6 for the employee tuples).\n",

      "\n",
      "The CASE construct can also be used when inserting tuples that can have different attributes being NULL depending on the type of record being inserted into a table, as when a specialization (see Chapter 4) is mapped into a single table (see Chapter 9) or when a union type is mapped into relations.\n",

      "7.1.10 Recursive Queries in SQL In this section, we illustrate how to write a recursive query in SQL. This syntax was added in SQL:99 to allow users the capability to specify a recursive query in a declarative manner.

      "An example of a recursive oper-ation is to retrieve all supervisees of a supervisory employee e at all levels—that is, all employees e′ directly supervised by e, all employees e′ directly supervised by each employee e′, all employees e″′ directly supervised by each employee e″, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "In SQL:99, this query can be written as follows: Q29:    WITH RECURSIVE  SUP_EMP (SupSsn, EmpSsn)  AS ( SELECT  SupervisorSsn, Ssn FROM  EMPLOYEE UNION SELECT  E.Ssn, S.SupSsn FROM  EMPLOYEE  AS E, SUP_EMP  AS S WHERE  E.SupervisorSsn = S.EmpSsn) SELECT * FROM  SUP_EMP; In Q29, we are defining a view SUP_EMP that will hold the result of the recursive query.\n",
      "\n",
      "The view is initially empty. It is first loaded with the first level (supervisor, supervisee) Ssn combinations via the first part ( SELECT  SupervisorSss, Ssn FROM EMPLOYEE), which is called the base query . This will be combined via UNION with each successive level of supervisees through the second part, where the view contents are joined again with the base values to get the second level combinations, which are UNIONed with the first level.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is repeated with successive levels until a fixed point  is reached, where no more tuples are added to the view. At this point, the result of the recursive query is in the view SUP_EMP.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.1.11 Discussion and Summary of SQL Queries A retrieval query in SQL can consist of up to six clauses, but only the first two— SELECT  and FROM —are mandatory. The query can span several lines, and is ended by a semicolon. Query terms are separated by spaces, and parentheses can be used to group relevant parts of a query in the standard way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clauses are 224 Chapter 7 More SQL: Complex Queries, Triggers, Views, and Schema Modification specified in the following order, with the clauses between square brackets [ … ] being optional: SELECT  <attribute and function list> FROM  <table list> [ WHERE  <condition> ] [ GROUP BY  <grouping attribute(s)> ] [ HAVING  <group condition> ] [ ORDER BY  <attribute list> ]; The SELECT  clause lists the attributes or functions to be retrieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FROM  clause specifies all relations (tables) needed in the query, including joined relations, but not those in nested queries. The WHERE  clause specifies the conditions for selecting the tuples from these relations, including join conditions if needed. GROUP BY specifies grouping attributes, whereas HAVING  specifies a condition on the groups being selected rather than on the individual tuples.\n",
      "\n",
      "The built-in aggregate functions COUNT , SUM , MIN, MAX , and AVG  are used in conjunction with grouping, but they can also be applied to all the selected tuples in a query without a GROUP BY  clause. Finally, ORDER BY  specifies an order for displaying the result of a query. In order to formulate queries correctly, it is useful to consider the steps that define the meaning  or semantics  of each query.\n",
      "\n",
      "A query is evaluated conceptually4 by first applying the FROM  clause (to identify all tables involved in the query or to materialize any joined tables), followed by the WHERE  clause to select and join tuples, and then by GROUP BY  and HAVING . Conceptually, ORDER BY  is applied at the end to sort the query result.\n",
      "\n",
      "If none of the last three clauses ( GROUP BY , HAVING , and ORDER BY ) are speci- fied, we can think conceptually  of a query as being executed as follows: For each combi- nation of tuples —one from each of the relations specified in the FROM  clause—evaluate the WHERE  clause; if it evaluates to TRUE , place the values of the attributes specified in the SELECT  clause from this tuple combination in the result of the query.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, this is not an efficient way to implement the query in a real system, and each DBMS has special query optimization routines to decide on an execution plan that is efficient to execute. We discuss query processing and optimization in Chapters 18 and 19. In general, there are numerous ways to specify the same query in SQL. This flexibility in specifying queries has advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage is that users can choose the technique with which they are most comfortable when specifying a query.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, many queries may be specified with join conditions in the WHERE  clause, or by using joined relations in the FROM  clause, or with some form of nested queries and the IN comparison operator. Some users may be more comfortable with one approach, whereas others may be more comfortable with another. From the programmer’s and the system’s point of view regarding query optimization, it is gener- ally preferable to write a query with as little nesting and implied ordering as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The disadvantage of having numerous ways of specifying the same query is that this may confuse the user, who may not know which technique to use to specify 4The actual order of query evaluation is implementation dependent; this is just a way to conceptually view a query in order to correctly formulate it. 7.2 Specifying Constraints as Assertions and Actions as Triggers  225 particular types of queries. Another problem is that it may be more efficient to execute a query specified in one way than the same query specified in an alterna-tive way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ideally, this should not be the case: The DBMS should process the same query in the same way regardless of how the query is specified. But this is quite difficult in practice, since each DBMS has different methods for processing queries specified in different ways. Thus, an additional burden on the user is to determine which of the alternative specifications is the most efficient to execute. Ideally, the user should worry only about specifying the query correctly, whereas the DBMS would determine how to execute the query efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, however, it helps if the user is aware of which types of constructs in a query are more expen-sive to process than others.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.2  Specifying Constraints as Assertions   and Actions as Triggers In this section, we introduce two additional features of SQL: the CREATE ASSERTION statement and the CREATE TRIGGER  statement. Section 7.2.1 discusses CREATE ASSERTION , which can be used to specify additional types of constraints that are outside the scope of the built-in relational model constraints  (primary and unique keys, entity integrity, and referential integrity) that we presented in Section 5.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "These built-in constraints can be specified within the CREATE TABLE  statement of SQL (see Sections 6.1 and 6.2). In Section 7.2.2 we introduce CREATE TRIGGER , which can be used to specify auto- matic actions that the database system will perform when certain events and condi-tions occur. This type of functionality is generally referred to as active databases . We only introduce the basics of triggers  in this chapter, and present a more com- plete discussion of active databases in Section 26.1.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.2.1 Specifying General Constraints as Assertions in SQL In SQL, users can specify general constraints—those that do not fall into any of the categories described in Sections 6.1 and 6.2— via declarative assertions , using the CREATE ASSERTION  statement. Each assertion is given a constraint name and is specified via a condition similar to the WHERE  clause of an SQL query.\n",

      "For exam- ple, to specify the constraint that the salary of an employee must not be greater than the salary of the manager of the department that the employee works for  in SQL, we can write the following assertion: CREATE ASSERTION  SALARY_CONSTRAINT CHECK  ( NOT EXISTS  ( SELECT  * FROM  EMPLOYEE E, EMPLOYEE M, DEPARTMENT D WHERE  E.Salary>M.Salary AND  E.Dno = D.Dnumber AND  D.Mgr_ssn = M.Ssn  ) );226 Chapter 7 More SQL: Complex Queries, Triggers, Views, and Schema Modification The constraint name SALARY_CONSTRAINT is followed by the keyword CHECK , which is followed by a condition  in parentheses that must hold true on every data- base state for the assertion to be satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "The constraint name can be used later to disable the constraint or to modify or drop it. The DBMS is responsible for ensur-ing that the condition is not violated. Any WHERE  clause condition can be used, but many constraints can be specified using the EXISTS  and NOT EXISTS  style of SQL conditions. Whenever some tuples in the database cause the condition of an ASSERTION  statement to evaluate to FALSE , the constraint is violated . The con- straint is satisfied  by a database state if no combination of tuples  in that database state violates the constraint.\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic technique for writing such assertions is to specify a query that selects any tuples that violate the desired condition . By including this query inside a NOT EXISTS clause, the assertion will specify that the result of this query must be empty so that the condition will always be TRUE . Thus, the assertion is violated if the result of the query is not empty. In the preceding example, the query selects all employees whose salaries are greater than the salary of the manager of their department. If the result of the query is not empty, the assertion is violated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that the CHECK  clause and constraint condition can also be used to specify constraints on individual  attributes and domains (see Section 6.2.1) and on indi- vidual  tuples (see Section 6.2.4). A major difference between CREATE ASSERTION  and the individual domain constraints and tuple constraints is that the CHECK  clauses on individual attributes, domains, and tuples are checked in SQL only when tuples are inserted or updated  in a specific table. Hence, con- straint checking can be implemented more efficiently by the DBMS in these cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "The schema designer should use CHECK  on attributes, domains, and tuples only when he or she is sure that the constraint can only be violated by insertion or updating of tuples . On the other hand, the schema designer should use CREATE ASSERTION  only in cases where it is not possible to use CHECK  on attributes, domains, or tuples, so that simple checks are implemented more efficiently by the DBMS .\n",
      "\n",
      "7.2.2 Introduction to Triggers in SQL Another important statement in SQL is CREATE TRIGGER . In many cases it is con- venient to specify the type of action to be taken when certain events occur and when certain conditions are satisfied. For example, it may be useful to specify a condition that, if violated, causes some user to be informed of the violation. A man-ager may want to be informed if an employee’s travel expenses exceed a certain limit by receiving a message whenever this occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The action that the DBMS must take in this case is to send an appropriate message to that user. The condition is thus used to monitor  the database. Other actions may be specified, such as execut- ing a specific stored procedure  or triggering other updates. The CREATE TRIGGER statement is used to implement such actions in SQL. We discuss triggers in detail in Section 26.1 when we describe active databases . Here we just give a simple example of how triggers may be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.2 Specifying Constraints as Assertions and Actions as Triggers  227 Suppose we want to check whenever an employee’s salary is greater than the salary of his or her direct supervisor in the COMPANY  database (see Figures 5.5 and 5.6). Several events can trigger this rule: inserting a new employee record, changing an employee’s salary, or changing an employee’s supervisor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose that the action to take would be to call an external stored procedure SALARY_VIOLATION ,5 which will notify the supervisor. The trigger could then be written as in R5 below. Here we are using the syntax of the Oracle database system.\n",
      "\n",
      "R5: CREATE TRIGGER  SALARY_VIOLATION BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OF  SALARY, SUPERVISOR_SSN ON EMPLOYEE FOR EACH ROW WHEN  ( NEW .SALARY >  ( SELECT  SALARY  FROM  EMPLOYEE WHERE  SSN =  NEW .SUPERVISOR_SSN ) ) INFORM_SUPERVISOR( NEW .Supervisor_ssn, NEW .Ssn ); The trigger is given the name SALARY_VIOLATION , which can be used to remove or deactivate the trigger later.\n",
      "\n",
      "A typical trigger which is regarded as an ECA (Event, Condition, Action) rule has three components: 1. The event(s) : These are usually database update operations that are explic- itly applied to the database. In this example the events are: inserting a new employee record, changing an employee’s salary, or changing an employee’s supervisor. The person who writes the trigger must make sure that all pos- sible events are accounted for. In some cases, it may be necessary to write more than one trigger to cover all possible cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "These events are specified after the keyword BEFORE  in our example, which means that the trigger should be executed before the triggering operation is executed. An alterna- tive is to use the keyword AFTER , which specifies that the trigger should be executed after the operation specified in the event is completed. 2. The condition  that determines whether the rule action should be executed: Once the triggering event has occurred, an optional  condition may be evalu- ated. If no condition  is specified, the action will be executed once the event occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a condition is specified, it is first evaluated, and only if it evaluates to true  will the rule action be executed. The condition is specified in the WHEN clause of the trigger. 3. The action  to be taken: The action is usually a sequence of SQL statements, but it could also be a database transaction or an external program that will be automatically executed. In this example, the action is to execute the stored procedure INFORM_SUPERVISOR .\n",
      "\n",
      "Triggers can be used in various applications, such as maintaining database consis- tency, monitoring database updates, and updating derived data automatically. A complete discussion is given in Section 26.1. 5Assuming that an appropriate external procedure has been declared.

      "7.3 Views (Virtual Tables) in SQL   In this section we introduce the concept of a view in SQL. We show how views are specified, and then we discuss the problem of updating views and how views can be implemented by the DBMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.3.1 Concept of a View in SQL A view  in SQL terminology is a single table that is derived from other tables.6  These other tables can be base tables  or previously defined views. A view does not neces- sarily exist in physical form; it is considered to be a virtual table , in contrast to base tables , whose tuples are always physically stored in the database. This limits the possible update operations that can be applied to views, but it does not provide any limitations on querying a view.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can think of a view as a way of specifying a table that we need to reference frequently, even though it may not exist physically. For example, referring to the COMPANY  database in Figure 5.5, we may frequently issue queries that retrieve the employee name and the project names that the employee works on. Rather than having to specify the join of the three tables EMPLOYEE , WORKS_ON , and PROJECT every time we issue this query, we can define a view that is specified as the result of these joins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we can issue queries on the view, which are specified as single-table retrievals rather than as retrievals involving two joins on three tables. We call the EMPLOYEE , WORKS_ON , and PROJECT  tables the defining tables  of the view.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.3.2 Specification of Views in SQL In SQL, the command to specify a view is CREATE VIEW . The view is given a (vir- tual) table name (or view name), a list of attribute names, and a query to specify the contents of the view. If none of the view attributes results from applying functions or arithmetic operations, we do not have to specify new attribute names for the view, since they would be the same as the names of the attributes of the defining tables in the default case.\n",
      "\n",
      "The views in V1 and V2 create virtual tables whose sche- mas are illustrated in Figure 7.2 when applied to the database schema of Figure 5.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "V1: CREATE VIEW  WORKS_ON1 AS SELECT  Fname, Lname, Pname, Hours FROM  EMPLOYEE, PROJECT, WORKS_ON WHERE  Ssn = Essn  AND  Pno = Pnumber; V2: CREATE VIEW  DEPT_INFO(Dept_name, No_of_emps, Total_sal) AS SELECT  Dname,  COUNT  (*), SUM  (Salary) FROM  DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE WHERE  Dnumber = Dno GROUP BY  Dname; 6As used in SQL, the term view is more limited than the term user view  discussed in Chapters 1 and 2, since a user view would possibly include many relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.3 Views (Virtual Tables) in SQL  229 In V1, we did not specify any new attribute names for the view WORKS_ON1 (although we could have); in this case, WORKS_ON1  inherits  the names of the view attributes from the defining tables EMPLOYEE , PROJECT , and WORKS_ON .\n",
      "\n",
      "View V2 explicitly specifies new attribute names for the view DEPT_INFO , using a one-to-one correspondence between the attributes specified in the CREATE VIEW  clause and those specified in the SELECT  clause of the query that defines the view. We can now specify SQL queries on a view—or virtual table—in the same way we specify queries involving base tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, to retrieve the last name and first name of all employees who work on the ‘ProductX’ project, we can utilize the WORKS_ON1  view and specify the query as in QV1: QV1:  SELECT  Fname, Lname FROM  WORKS_ON1 WHERE  Pname = ‘ProductX’; The same query would require the specification of two joins if specified on the base relations directly; one of the main advantages of a view is to simplify the specifica-tion of certain queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Views are also used as a security and authorization mecha-nism (see Section 7.3.4 and Chapter 30). A view is supposed to be always up-to-date ; if we modify the tuples in the base tables on which the view is defined, the view must automatically reflect these changes. Hence, the view does not have to be realized or materialized at the time of view definition  but rather at the time when we specify a query  on the view.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the responsibility of the DBMS and not the user to make sure that the view is kept up-to-date. We will discuss various ways the DBMS can utilize to keep a view up-to-date in the next subsection. If we do not need a view anymore, we can use the DROP VIEW  command to dispose of it. For example, to get rid of the view V1, we can use the SQL statement in V1A: V1A:  DROP VIEW  WORKS_ON1;\n",
      "\n",
      "7.3.3 View Implementation, View Update, and Inline Views The problem of how a DBMS can efficiently implement a view for efficient querying is complex. Two main approaches have been suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "One strategy, called query modification , involves modifying or transforming the view query (submitted by the DEPT_INFO Dept_name No_of_emps Total_salWORKS_ON1 Fname Lname Pname Hours Figure 7.2 Two views specified on the database schema of Figure 5.5.230 Chapter 7 More SQL: Complex Queries, Triggers, Views, and Schema Modification user) into a query on the underlying base tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the query QV1 would be automatically modified to the following query by the DBMS: SELECT  Fname, Lname FROM  EMPLOYEE, PROJECT, WORKS_ON WHERE  Ssn = Essn  AND  Pno = Pnumber AND  Pname = ‘ProductX’ ; The disadvantage of this approach is that it is inefficient for views defined via com- plex queries that are time-consuming to execute, especially if multiple view queries are going to be applied to the same view within a short period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second strategy, called view materialization , involves physically creating a temporary or permanent view table when the view is first queried or created and keeping that table on the assumption that other queries on the view will follow. In this case, an efficient strategy for automatically updating the view table when the base tables are updated must be developed in order to keep the view up-to-date.\n",
      "\n",
      "Techniques using the concept of incremental update  have been developed for this purpose, where the DBMS can determine what new tuples must be inserted, deleted, or modified in a materialized view table  when a database update is applied to one of the defining base tables . The view is generally kept as a materialized (physically stored) table as long as it is being queried. If the view is not queried for a certain period of time, the system may then automatically remove the physical table and recompute it from scratch when future queries reference the view.\n",
      "\n",
      "Different strategies as to when a materialized view is updated are possible. The immediate update  strategy updates a view as soon as the base tables are changed; the lazy update  strategy updates the view when needed by a view query; and the periodic update  strategy updates the view periodically (in the latter strategy, a view query may get a result that is not up-to-date). A user can always issue a retrieval query against any view. However, issuing an INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE command on a view table is in many cases not pos-sible.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, an update on a view defined on a single table  without any aggregate functions  can be mapped to an update on the underlying base table under certain conditions. For a view involving joins, an update operation may be mapped to update operations on the underlying base relations in multiple ways . Hence, it is often not possible for the DBMS to determine which of the updates is intended.\n",
      "\n",
      "To illustrate potential problems with updating a view defined on multiple tables, con-sider the WORKS_ON1  view, and suppose that we issue the command to update the PNAME  attribute of ‘John Smith’ from ‘ProductX’ to ‘ProductY’.\n",
      "\n",
      "This view update is shown in UV1: UV1:  UPDATE  WORKS_ON1 SET Pname = ‘ProductY’ WHERE  Lname = ‘Smith’ AND  Fname = ‘John’ AND  Pname = ‘ProductX’ ; This query can be mapped into several updates on the base relations to give the desired update effect on the view. In addition, some of these updates will create  7.3 Views (Virtual Tables) in SQL  231 additional side effects that affect the result of other queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, here are two possible updates, (a) and (b), on the base relations corresponding to the view update operation in UV1: (a): UPDATE  WORKS_ON SET Pno =  ( SELECT  Pnumber FROM  PROJECT WHERE  Pname = ‘ProductY’ ) WHERE  Essn  IN ( SELECT  Ssn FROM  EMPLOYEE WHERE  Lname = ‘Smith’ AND Fname  = ‘John’ ) AND Pno =  ( SELECT  Pnumber FROM  PROJECT WHERE  Pname = ‘ProductX’ ); (b): UPDATE  PROJECT    SET  Pname =  ‘ProductY’ WHERE  Pname =  ‘ProductX’ ; Update (a) relates ‘John Smith’ to the ‘ProductY’ PROJECT  tuple instead of the ‘ProductX’ PROJECT  tuple and is the most likely desired update.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, (b) would also give the desired update effect on the view, but it accomplishes this by changing the name of the ‘ProductX’ tuple in the PROJECT  relation to ‘ProductY’. It is quite unlikely that the user who specified the view update UV1 wants the update to be interpreted as in (b), since it also has the side effect of changing all the view tuples with Pname  = ‘ProductX’.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some view updates may not make much sense; for example, modifying the Total_sal attribute of the DEPT_INFO  view does not make sense because Total_sal  is defined to be the sum of the individual employee salaries. This incorrect request is shown as UV2: UV2:  UPDATE   DEPT_INFO SET Total_sal = 100000 WHERE  Dname = ‘Research’; Generally, a view update is feasible when only one possible update  on the base rela- tions can accomplish the desired update operation on the view.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever an update on the view can be mapped to more than one update  on the underlying base relations, it is usually not permitted. Some researchers have suggested that the DBMS have a certain procedure for choosing one of the possible updates as the most likely one. Some researchers have developed methods for choosing the most likely update, whereas other researchers prefer to have the user choose the desired update mapping during view definition. But these options are generally not avail-able in most commercial DBMSs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, we can make the following observations: ■A view with a single defining table is updatable if the view attributes contain the primary key of the base relation, as well as all attributes with the NOT NULL  constraint that do not have  default values specified.232 Chapter 7 More SQL: Complex Queries, Triggers, Views, and Schema Modification ■Views defined on multiple tables using joins are generally not updatable. ■Views defined using grouping and aggregate functions are not updatable.\n",
      "\n",
      "In SQL, the clause WITH CHECK OPTION  should be added at the end of the view definition if a view is to be updated  by INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE statements. This allows the system to reject operations that violate the SQL rules for view updates. The full set of SQL rules for when a view may be modified by the user are more complex than the rules stated earlier. It is also possible to define a view table in the FROM  clause  of an SQL query. This is known as an in-line view .\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, the view is defined within the query itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.3.4 Views as Authorization Mechanisms We describe SQL query authorization statements (GRANT and REVOKE) in detail in Chapter 30, when we present database security and authorization mechanisms. Here, we will just give a couple of simple examples to illustrate how views can be used to hide certain attributes or tuples from unauthorized users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose a certain user is only allowed to see employee information for employees who work for department 5; then we can create the following view DEPT5EMP and grant the user the privilege to query the view but not the base table EMPLOYEE itself. This user will only be able to retrieve employee information for employee tuples whose  Dno = 5, and will not be able to see other employee tuples when the view is queried.\n",
      "\n",
      "CREATE VIEW  DEPT5EMP  AS SELECT  * FROM  EMPLOYEE WHERE  Dno = 5; In a similar manner, a view can restrict a user to only see certain columns; for example, only the first name, last name, and address of an employee may be visible as follows: CREATE VIEW  BASIC_EMP_DATA  AS SELECT  Fname, Lname, Address FROM  EMPLOYEE; Thus by creating an appropriate view and granting certain users access to the view and not the base tables, they would be restricted to retrieving only the data specified in the view.\n",

      "7.4 Schema Change Statements in SQL   In this section, we give an overview of the schema evolution commands  available in SQL, which can be used to alter a schema by adding or dropping tables, attri- butes, constraints, and other schema elements. This can be done while the database is operational and does not require recompilation of the database schema. Certain  7.4 Schema Change Statements in SQL  233 checks must be done by the DBMS to ensure that the changes do not affect the rest of the database and make it inconsistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.4.1 The DROP Command The DROP  command can be used to drop named  schema elements, such as tables, domains, types, or constraints. One can also drop a whole schema if it is no longer needed by using the DROP SCHEMA  command. There are two drop behavior options: CASCADE  and RESTRICT .\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, to remove the COMPANY  database schema and all its tables, domains, and other elements, the CASCADE  option is used as follows: DROP SCHEMA  COMPANY  CASCADE ; If the RESTRICT  option is chosen in place of CASCADE , the schema is dropped only if it has no elements  in it; otherwise, the DROP  command will not be executed. To use the RESTRICT  option, the user must first individually drop each element in the schema, then drop the schema itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a base relation within a schema is no longer needed, the relation and its definition can be deleted by using the DROP TABLE  command.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if we no longer wish to keep track of dependents of employees in the COMPANY  database of Fig- ure 6.1, we can get rid of the DEPENDENT  relation by issuing the following command: DROP TABLE  DEPENDENT  CASCADE ; If the RESTRICT  option is chosen instead of CASCADE , a table is dropped only if it is not referenced  in any constraints (for example, by foreign key definitions in another relation) or views (see Section 7.3) or by any other elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the CASCADE option, all such constraints, views, and other elements that reference the table being dropped are also dropped automatically from the schema, along with the table itself. Notice that the DROP TABLE  command not only deletes all the records in the table if successful, but also removes the table definition  from the catalog. If it is desired to delete only the records but to leave the table definition for future use, then the DELETE  command (see Section 6.4.2) should be used instead of DROP TABLE .\n",

      "\n",
      "7.4.2 The ALTER Command The definition of a base table or of other named schema elements can be changed by using the ALTER  command. For base tables, the possible alter table actions include adding or dropping a column (attribute), changing a column definition, and adding or dropping table constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, to add an attribute for keeping track of jobs of employees to the EMPLOYEE  base relation in the COMPANY schema (see Figure 6.1), we can use the command ALTER TABLE  COMPANY.EMPLOYEE  ADD COLUMN  Job VARCHAR(12);234 Chapter 7 More SQL: Complex Queries, Triggers, Views, and Schema Modification We must still enter a value for the new attribute Job for each individual EMPLOYEE tuple.\n",
      "\n",
      "This can be done either by specifying a default clause or by using the UPDATE command individually on each tuple (see Section 6.4.3). If no default clause is speci-fied, the new attribute will have NULL s in all the tuples of the relation immediately after the command is executed; hence, the NOT NULL  constraint is not allowed  in this case. To drop a column, we must choose either CASCADE  or RESTRICT  for drop behav- ior.\n",
      "\n",
      "If CASCADE  is chosen, all constraints and views that reference the column are dropped automatically from the schema, along with the column. If RESTRICT  is chosen, the command is successful only if no views or constraints (or other schema elements) reference the column.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the following command removes the attribute Address  from the EMPLOYEE  base table: ALTER TABLE  COMPANY.EMPLOYEE  DROP COLUMN  Address  CASCADE ; It is also possible to alter a column definition by dropping an existing default clause or by defining a new default clause.\n",

      "The following examples illustrate this clause: ALTER TABLE  COMPANY.DEPARTMENT  ALTER COLUMN  Mgr_ssn DROP DEFAULT ; ALTER TABLE  COMPANY.DEPARTMENT  ALTER COLUMN  Mgr_ssn SET DEFAULT  ‘333445555’ ; One can also change the constraints specified on a table by adding or dropping a named constraint. To be dropped, a constraint must have been given a name when it was specified.\n",

      "8.1.1 The SELECT Operation The SELECT  operation is used to choose a subset  of the tuples from a relation that satisfies a selection condition .3 We can consider the SELECT  operation to be a filter that keeps only those tuples that satisfy a qualifying condition. Alternatively, we can consider the SELECT  operation to restrict  the tuples in a relation to only those tuples that satisfy the condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SELECT  operation can also be visualized as a horizon- tal partition  of the relation into two sets of tuples—those tuples that satisfy the con- dition and are selected, and those tuples that do not satisfy the condition and are filtered out.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, to select the EMPLOYEE  tuples whose department is 4, or those whose salary is greater than $30,000, we can individually specify each of these two conditions with a SELECT  operation as follows: σDno=4(EMPLOYEE ) σSalary >30000 (EMPLOYEE ) In general, the SELECT  operation is denoted by σ<selection condition >(R) where the symbol σ (sigma) is used to denote the SELECT  operator and the selec- tion condition is a Boolean expression (condition) specified on the attributes of relation R. Notice that R is generally a relational algebra expression  whose result is a relation—the simplest such expression is just the name of a database relation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The relation resulting from the SELECT  operation has the same attributes  as R. The Boolean expression specified in <selection condition> is made up of a number of clauses  of the form <attribute name> <comparison op> <constant value> 2In this chapter no familiarity with first-order predicate calculus—which deals with quantified variables and values—is assumed. 3The SELECT operation is different  from the SELECT clause of SQL.\n",

      "8.1 Unary Relational Operations: SELECT and PROJECT  243 In general, the result of a SELECT  operation can be determined as follows. The <selection condition> is applied independently to each individual tuple t  in R. This is done by substituting each occurrence of an attribute Ai in the selection condition with its value in the tuple t[Ai]. If the condition evaluates to TRUE , then tuple t is selected . All the selected tuples appear in the result of the SELECT  operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Boolean conditions AND , OR, and NOT  have their normal interpretation, as follows: ■(cond1 AND  cond2) is TRUE  if both (cond1) and (cond2) are TRUE ; other- wise, it is FALSE . ■(cond1 OR cond2) is TRUE  if either (cond1) or (cond2) or both are TRUE ; otherwise, it is FALSE . ■(NOT  cond) is TRUE  if cond is FALSE ; otherwise, it is FALSE .\n",
      "\n",
      "The SELECT  operator is unary ; that is, it is applied to a single relation. Moreover, the selection operation is applied to each tuple individually ; hence, selection condi- tions cannot involve more than one tuple.\n",
      "\n",
      "The degree  of the relation resulting from a SELECT  operation—its number of attributes—is the same as the degree of R. The number of tuples in the resulting relation is always less than or equal to  the number of tuples in R. That is, | σc (R)| ≤ | R| for any condition C. The fraction of tuples selected by a selection condition is referred to as the selectivity  of the condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that the SELECT  operation is commutative ; that is, σ<cond1 >(σ<cond2 >(R)) = σ<cond2 >(σ<cond1 >(R)) Hence, a sequence of SELECT s can be applied in any order.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, we can always combine a cascade  (or sequence ) of SELECT  operations into a single SELECT operation with a conjunctive ( AND ) condition; that is, σ<cond1 >(σ<cond2 >(... (σ<cond n>(R)) ...)) = σ<cond1 > AND <cond2 > AND ...AND  <cond n>(R) In SQL, the SELECT  condition is typically specified in the WHERE  clause  of a query.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the following operation: σDno=4 AND  Salary >25000  (EMPLOYEE ) would correspond to the following SQL query: SELECT  * FROM  EMPLOYEE WHERE  Dno=4 AND  Salary >25000 ;\n",
      "\n",
      "8.1.2 The PROJECT Operation If we think of a relation as a table, the SELECT  operation chooses some of the rows from the table while discarding other rows. The PROJECT  operation, on the other hand, selects certain columns  from the table and discards the other columns. If we are interested in only certain attributes of a relation, we use the PROJECT  operation to project  the relation over these attributes only.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the result of the PROJECT operation can be visualized as a vertical partition  of the relation into two relations: 244 Chapter 8 The Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus one has the needed columns (attributes) and contains the result of the operation, and the other contains the discarded columns. For example, to list each employee’s first and last name and salary, we can use the PROJECT  operation as follows: πLname, Fname, Salary (EMPLOYEE ) The resulting relation is shown in Figure 8.1(b).\n",
      "\n",
      "The general form of the PROJECT operation is π<attribute list >(R) where π (pi) is the symbol used to represent the PROJECT  operation, and <attribute list> is the desired sublist of attributes from the attributes of relation R. Again, notice that R is, in general, a relational algebra expression  whose result is a relation, which in the simplest case is just the name of a database relation. The result of the PROJECT  operation has only the attributes specified in <attribute list> in the same order as they appear in the list .\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, its degree  is equal to the number of attributes in <attribute list>. If the attribute list includes only nonkey attributes of R, duplicate tuples are likely to occur. The PROJECT  operation removes any duplicate tuples , so the result of the PROJECT  operation is a set of distinct tuples, and hence a valid relation. This is known as duplicate elimination . For example, consider the following PROJECT  operation: πSex, Salary (EMPLOYEE ) The result is shown in Figure 8.1(c).\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that the tuple <‘F’, 25000> appears only once in Figure 8.1(c), even though this combination of values appears twice in the EMPLOYEE  relation. Duplicate elimination involves sorting or some other technique to detect duplicates and thus adds more processing. If duplicates are not eliminated, the result would be a multiset  or bag of tuples rather than a set. This was not permitted in the formal relational model but is allowed in SQL (see Section 6.3).\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of tuples in a relation resulting from a PROJECT  operation is always less than or equal to the number of tuples in R. If the projection list is a superkey of R—that is, it includes some key of R—the resulting relation has the same number  of tuples as R. Moreover, π<list1> (π<list2>(R)) = π<list1>(R) as long as <list2> contains the attributes in <list1>; otherwise, the left-hand side is an incorrect expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also noteworthy that commutativity does not  hold on PROJECT . In SQL, the PROJECT  attribute list is specified in the SELECT  clause  of a query.\n",

In general, for most queries, we need to apply several relational algebra operations one after the other. Either we can write the operations as a single  relational algebra expression  by nesting the operations, or we can apply one operation at a time and create intermediate result relations. In the latter case, we must give names to the relations that hold the intermediate results.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, to retrieve the first name, last name, and salary of all employees who work in department number 5, we must apply a SELECT  and a PROJECT  operation. We can write a sin- gle relational algebra expression, also known as an in-line expression , as follows: πFname, Lname, Salary (σDno=5(EMPLOYEE )) Figure 8.2(a) shows the result of this in-line relational algebra expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alterna- tively, we can explicitly show the sequence of operations, giving a name to each intermediate relation, and using the assignment operation,  denoted by ← (left arrow), as follows: DEP5_EMPS ← σDno=5(EMPLOYEE ) RESULT ← πFname, Lname, Salary (DEP5_EMPS ) It is sometimes simpler to break down a complex sequence of operations by specify- ing intermediate result relations than to write a single relational algebra expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can also use this technique to rename  the attributes in the intermediate and result relations. This can be useful in connection with more complex operations such as UNION  and JOIN , as we shall see.\n",

      "To rename the attributes in a relation, we simply list the new attribute names in parentheses, as in the following example: TEMP ← σDno=5(EMPLOYEE ) R(First_name, Last_name, Salary ) ← πFname, Lname, Salary (TEMP ) These two operations are illustrated in Figure 8.2(b).If no renaming is applied, the names of the attributes in the resulting relation of a SELECT  operation are the same as those in the original relation and in the same order.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a PROJECT  operation with no renaming, the resulting relation has the same attribute names as those in the projection list and in the same order in which they appear in the list. We can also define a formal RENAME  operation—which can rename either the rela- tion name or the attribute names, or both—as a unary operator.\n",
      "\n",
      "The general RENAME  operation when applied to a relation R of degree n is denoted by any of the following three forms: ρS(B1, B2, ... , Bn)(R)   or   ρS(R)   or   ρ(B1, B2, ... , Bn)(R)246 Chapter 8 The Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus where the symbol ρ (rho) is used to denote the RENAME  operator, S is the new rela- tion name, and B1, B2, … , Bn are the new attribute names.\n",

These operations are also known as inner joins , to distinguish them from a different join variation called outer joins  (see Section 8.4.4).\n",

The first method is to specify the <join conditions> in the WHERE  clause, along with any other selection condi- tions.\n",

This means that, for a tuple t to appear in the result T of the DIVISION , the values in t must appear in R in combination with every tuple  in S. Note that in the formulation of the DIVISION operation, the tuples in the denominator relation S restrict the numerator rela- tion R by selecting those tuples in the result that match all values present in the denominator.\n",

The notation is called a query tree  or sometimes it is known as a query evaluation tree  or query execution tree .

A query tree  is a tree data structure that corresponds to a relational algebra expres- sion.\n",

      "It represents the input relations of the query as leaf nodes  of the tree, and rep- resents the relational algebra operations as internal nodes. An execution of the query tree consists of executing an internal node operation whenever its operands (represented by its child nodes) are available, and then replacing that internal node by the relation that results from executing the operation. The execution terminates when the root node is executed and produces the result relation for the query.\n",

We will revisit query trees when we discuss query processing and optimization in Chapters 18 and 19.\n",

      "8.4.2 Aggregate Functions and Grouping Another type of request that cannot be expressed in the basic relational algebra is to specify mathematical aggregate functions  on collections of values from the database. Examples of such functions include retrieving the average or total salary of all employees or the total number of employee tuples. These functions are used in simple statistical queries that summarize information from the database tuples. Common functions applied to collections of numeric values include SUM , AVERAGE , MAXIMUM , and MINIMUM .\n",
      "\n",
      "The COUNT  function is used for counting tuples or values. Another common type of request involves grouping the tuples in a relation by the value of some of their attributes and then applying an aggregate function indepen- dently to each group . An example would be to group EMPLOYEE  tuples by Dno, so that each group includes the tuples for employees working in the same department. We can then list each Dno value along with, say, the average salary of employees within the department, or the number of employees who work in the department.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can define an AGGREGATE FUNCTION  operation, using the symbol I (pro- nounced script F )7, to specify these types of requests as follows: <grouping attributes>  ℑ <function list>  (R) where <grouping attributes> is a list of attributes of the relation specified in R, and <function list> is a list of (<function> <attribute>) pairs.\n",

      "In each such pair, <function> is one of the allowed functions—such as SUM , AVERAGE , MAXIMUM , MINIMUM , COUNT —and <attribute> is an attribute of the relation specified by R. The resulting relation has the grouping attributes plus one attribute for each element in the function list.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, to retrieve each department number, the number of employees in the department, and their average salary, while renaming the resulting attributes as indicated below, we write: ρ R(Dno, No_of_employees, Average_sal ) (Dno ℑ COUNT Ssn, AVERAGE Salary  (EMPLOYEE )) 7There is no single agreed-upon notation for specifying aggregate functions. In some cases a “script A” is used.\n",

      "8.4 Additional Relational Operations  261 The result of this operation on the EMPLOYEE  relation of Figure 5.6 is shown in Figure 8.10(a).\n",
      "\n",
      "In the preceding example, we specified a list of attribute names—between parenthe- ses in the RENAME  operation—for the resulting relation R. If no renaming is applied, then the attributes of the resulting relation that correspond to the function list will each be the concatenation of the function name with the attribute name in the form <function>_<attribute>.8 For example, Figure 8.10(b) shows the result of the fol- lowing operation: Dno ℑ COUNT Ssn, AVERAGE Salary (EMPLOYEE ) If no grouping attributes are specified, the functions are applied to all the tuples in the relation, so the resulting relation has a single tuple only .\n",

      "\n",
      "It is worth emphasizing that the result of applying an aggregate function is a relation, not a scalar number—even if it has a single value. This makes the relational algebra a closed mathematical system. 8Note that this is an arbitrary notation, consistent with what SQL would do.\n",

      "8.4.3 Recursive Closure Operations Another type of operation that, in general, cannot be specified in the basic original relational algebra is recursive closure. This operation is applied to a recursive relationship  between tuples of the same type, such as the relationship between an employee and a supervisor.\n",
      "\n",
      "This relationship is described by the foreign key Super_ssn  of the EMPLOYEE  relation in Figures 5.5 and 5.6, and it relates each employee tuple (in the role of supervisee) to another employee tuple (in the role of supervisor).\n",

      "An example of a recursive operation is to retrieve all supervisees of an employee e at all levels—that is, all employees e′ directly supervised by e, all employ- ees e′ℑ directly supervised by each employee e′, all employees e″′ directly super- vised by each employee e″, and so on. It is relatively straightforward in the relational algebra to specify all employees supervised by e at a specific level  by joining the table with itself one or more times. However, it is difficult to specify all supervisees at all levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, to specify the Ssns of all employees e′ directly supervised— at level one— by the employee e whose name is ‘James Borg’ (see Figure 5.6), we can apply the follow- ing operation: BORG_SSN  ← πSsn(σFname =‘James’  AND  Lname =‘Borg’ (EMPLOYEE )) SUPERVISION (Ssn1 , Ssn2 ) ← πSsn,Super_ssn (EMPLOYEE ) RESULT1 (Ssn) ← πSsn1(SUPERVISION   Ssn2 =SsnBORG_SSN) To retrieve all employees supervised by Borg at level 2—that is, all employees e″ supervised by some employee e′ who is directly supervised by Borg—we can apply another JOIN  to the result of the first query, as follows: RESULT2 (Ssn) ← πSsn1(SUPERVISION   Ssn2 =SsnRESULT1 ) To get both sets of employees supervised at levels 1 and 2 by ‘James Borg’, we can apply the UNION operation to the two results, as follows: RESULT  ← RESULT2  ∪ RESULT1 The results of these queries are illustrated in Figure 8.11.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although it is possible to retrieve employees at each level and then take their UNION , we cannot, in general, specify a query such as “retrieve the supervisees of ‘James Borg’ at all levels” without utilizing a looping mechanism unless we know the maximum number of levels. 10 An operation called the transitive closure  of relations has been proposed to com- pute the recursive relationship as far as the recursion proceeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.4.4 OUTER JOIN Operations Next, we discuss some additional extensions to the JOIN  operation that are nec- essary to specify certain types of queries. The JOIN  operations described earlier match tuples that satisfy the join condition. For example, for a NATURAL JOIN 10The SQL3 standard includes syntax for recursive closure. 8.4 Additional Relational Operations  263 operation R * S, only tuples from R that have matching tuples in S—and vice versa—appear in the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, tuples without a matching  (or related ) tuple are eliminated from the JOIN  result. Tuples with NULL  values in the join attri- butes are also eliminated. This type of join, where tuples with no match are elim-inated, is known as an inner join . The join operations we described earlier in Section 8.3 are all inner joins. This amounts to the loss of information if the user wants the result of the JOIN  to include all the tuples in one or more of the com- ponent relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "A set of operations, called outer joins , were developed for the case where the user wants to keep all the tuples in R, or all those in S, or all those in both relations in the result of the JOIN , regardless of whether or not they have matching tuples in the other relation. This satisfies the need of queries in which tuples from two tables are to be combined by matching corresponding rows, but without losing any tuples for lack of matching values.\n",

      "8.6 The Tuple Relational Calculus   In this and the next section, we introduce another formal query language for the relational model called relational calculus . This section introduces the language known as tuple relational calculus , and Section 8.7 introduces a variation called domain relational calculus . In both variations of relational calculus, we write one declarative  expression to specify a retrieval request; hence, there is no description of how, or in what order , to evaluate a query. A calculus expression specifies what  is to be retrieved rather than how to retrieve it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the relational calculus is considered to be a nonprocedural  language. This differs from relational algebra, where we must write a sequence of operations  to specify a retrieval request in a par- ticular order  of applying the operations; thus, it can be considered as a procedural way of stating a query. It is possible to nest algebra operations to form a single expression; however, a certain order among the operations is always explicitly spec-ified in a relational algebra expression. This order also influences the strategy for evaluating the query.\n",

      "A calculus expression may be written in different ways, but the way it is written has no bearing on how a query should be evaluated. It has been shown that any retrieval that can be specified in the basic relational alge- bra can also be specified in relational calculus, and vice versa; in other words, the expressive power  of the languages is identical . This led to the definition of the con- cept of a relationally complete  language. A relational query language L is considered relationally complete  if we can express in L any query that can be expressed in relational calculus.\n",

      "Relational completeness has become an important basis for comparing the expressive power of high-level query languages. However, as we saw in Section 8.4, certain frequently required queries in database applications cannot be expressed in basic relational algebra or calculus. Most relational query languages are relationally complete but have more expressive power  than relational algebra or relational calculus because of additional operations such as aggregate functions, grouping, and ordering. As we mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, the relational calculus is important for two reasons.\n",

      "A simple tuple relational calculus query is of the form: {t | COND (t)} where t is a tuple variable and COND (t) is a conditional (Boolean) expression involving t that evaluates to either TRUE  or FALSE  for different assignments of tuples to the variable t.

Each EMPLOYEE  tuple t that satisfies the condition t.Salary >50000 will be retrieved.\n",

      "The trick is to exclude from the universal quantification all tuples that we are not interested in by making the condition TRUE  for all such tuples . This is necessary because a universally quantified tuple variable, such as x in Q3, must evaluate to TRUE  for every possible tuple  assigned to it to make the quantified formula TRUE . The first tuples to exclude (by making them evaluate automatically to TRUE ) are those that are not in the relation R of interest.\n",

      "Finally, we specify a condition F2 that must hold on all the remaining tuples in R. Hence, we can explain Q3 as follows: 1. For the formula F′ = (∀x)(F) to be TRUE , we must have the formula F be TRUE  for all tuples in the universe that can be assigned to x . However, in Q3 we are only interested in F being TRUE  for all tuples of the PROJECT  relation that are controlled by department 5. Hence, the formula F is of the form (NOT (PROJECT (x)) OR F1).\n",

      "The ‘ NOT  (PROJECT (x)) OR …’ condition is TRUE  for all tuples not in the PROJECT  relation  and has the effect of elimi- nating these tuples from consideration in the truth value of F1. For every tuple in the PROJECT  relation, F1 must be TRUE  if F′ is to be TRUE . 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the same line of reasoning, we do not want to consider tuples in the PROJECT  relation that are not controlled by department number 5, since we are only interested in PROJECT  tuples whose Dnum =5. Therefore, we can write: IF (x.Dnum =5) THEN  F2 which is equivalent to (NOT  (x.Dnum =5) OR F2) 3. Formula F1, hence, is of the form NOT (x.Dnum =5) OR F2.\n",

      "8.6.8 Safe Expressions Whenever we use universal quantifiers, existential quantifiers, or negation of predi- cates in a calculus expression, we must make sure that the resulting expression makes sense. A safe expression  in relational calculus is one that is guaranteed to yield a finite number of tuples  as its result; otherwise, the expression is called unsafe .\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the expression {t | NOT  (EMPLOYEE (t))} is unsafe  because it yields all tuples in the universe that are not EMPLOYEE  tuples, which are infinitely numerous. If we follow the rules for Q3 discussed earlier, we will get a safe expression when using universal quantifiers. We can define safe expressions more precisely by introducing the concept of the domain of a tuple relational calculus expression:  This is the set of all values that either appear as constant values in the expression or exist in any tuple in the relations referenced in the expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the domain of { t | NOT (EMPLOYEE (t))} is the set of all attribute values appearing in some tuple of the EMPLOYEE  relation (for any attribute). The domain of the expression Q3A  would include all values appearing in EMPLOYEE , PROJECT , and WORKS_ON  (unioned with the value 5 appearing in the query itself). An expression is said to be safe if all values in its result are from the domain of the expression.\n",

All of our other examples are safe expressions.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.7 The Domain Relational Calculus   There is another type of relational calculus called the domain relational calculus, or simply domain calculus . Historically, while SQL (see Chapters 6 and 7), which was based on tuple relational calculus, was being developed by IBM Research at San Jose, California, another language called QBE (Query-By-Example), which is related to domain calculus, was being developed almost concurrently at the IBM  T. J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "The formal specifi-cation of the domain calculus was proposed after the development of the QBE lan-guage and system. Domain calculus differs from tuple calculus in the type of variables  used in formu- las: Rather than having variables range over tuples, the variables range over single values from domains of attributes. To form a relation of degree n for a query result, we must have n of these domain variables —one for each attribute.\n",
      "\n",
      "An expression of the domain calculus is of the form {x 1, x2, ..., xn | COND (x1, x2, ..., xn, xn+1, xn+2, ..., xn+m)} where x1, x2, … , xn, xn+1, xn+2, … , xn+m are domain variables that range over domains (of attributes), and COND  is a condition  or formula  of the domain relational calculus. A formula is made up of atoms .\n",
      "\n",
      "The atoms of a formula are slightly different from those for the tuple calculus and can be one of the following: 1. An atom of the form R( x1, x2, … , xj), where R is the name of a relation of degree j and each xi, 1 ≤ i ≤ j, is a domain variable. This atom states that a list of values of < x1, x2, … , xj> must be a tuple in the relation whose name is R, where xi is the value of the ith attribute value of the tuple.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make a domain calculus expression more concise, we can drop the commas  in a list of vari- ables; thus, we can write: {x1, x2, ..., xn | R(x1 x2 x3) AND  ...} instead of: {x1, x2, ... , xn | R(x1, x2, x3) AND  ...} 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "An atom of the form xi op xj, where op is one of the comparison operators in the set {=, <, ≤, >, ≥, ≠}, and xi and xj are domain variables. 3. An atom of the form xi op c or c op xj, where op is one of the comparison operators in the set {=, <, ≤, >, ≥, ≠}, xi and xj are domain variables, and c is a constant value.\n",
      "\n",
      "As in tuple calculus, atoms evaluate to either TRUE  or FALSE  for a specific set of values, called the truth values  of the atoms. In case 1, if the domain variables are 278 Chapter 8 The Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus assigned values corresponding to a tuple of the specified relation R, then the atom is TRUE . In cases 2 and 3, if the domain variables are assigned values that satisfy the condition, then the atom is TRUE .\n",

      "8.8 Summary   In this chapter we presented two formal languages for the relational model of data. They are used to manipulate relations and produce new relations as answers to que-ries. We discussed the relational algebra and its operations, which are used to spec-ify a sequence of operations to specify a query. Then we introduced two types of relational calculi called tuple calculus and domain calculus. In Sections 8.1 through 8.3, we introduced the basic relational algebra operations and illustrated the types of queries for which each is used.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we discussed the unary relational operators SELECT  and PROJECT , as well as the RENAME  operation. Then, we discussed binary set theoretic operations requiring that relations on  which they are applied be union (or type) compatible; these include UNION , INTERSECTION , and SET DIFFERENCE . The CARTESIAN PRODUCT  operation is a set operation that can be used to combine tuples from two relations, producing all possible combinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is rarely used in practice; however, we showed how 280 Chapter 8 The Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus CARTESIAN PRODUCT  followed by SELECT  can be used to define matching tuples from two relations and leads to the JOIN  operation. Different JOIN  operations called THETA JOIN , EQUIJOIN , and NATURAL JOIN  were introduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Query trees were intro- duced as a graphical representation of relational algebra queries, which can also be used as the basis for internal data structures that the DBMS can use to represent a query. We discussed some important types of queries that cannot  be stated with the basic relational algebra operations but are important for practical situations. We intro-duced GENERALIZED PROJECTION  to use functions of attributes in the projection list and the AGGREGATE FUNCTION  operation to deal with aggregate types of statis- tical requests that summarize the information in the tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "We discussed recursive queries, for which there is no direct support in the algebra but which can be han-dled in a step-by-step approach, as we demonstrated. Then we presented the OUTER JOIN  and OUTER UNION  operations, which extend JOIN  and UNION  and allow all information in source relations to be preserved in the result. The last two sections described the basic concepts behind relational calculus, which is based on the branch of mathematical logic called predicate calculus.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two types of relational calculi: (1) the tuple relational calculus, which uses tuple variables that range over tuples (rows) of relations, and (2) the domain relational calculus, which uses domain variables that range over domains (columns of rela-tions). In relational calculus, a query is specified in a single declarative statement, without specifying any order or method for retrieving the query result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, rela-tional calculus is often considered to be a higher-level declarative  language than the relational algebra, because a relational calculus expression states what  we want to retrieve regardless of how the query may be executed. We introduced query graphs as an internal representation for queries in relational calculus. We also discussed the existential quantifier ( ∃) and the universal quanti- fier ( ∀). We discussed the problem of specifying safe queries whose results are finite. We also discussed rules for transforming universal into existential quantifi-ers, and vice versa.\n",
      "\n",

We use the COMPANY  database example to illustrate the mapping procedure. The COMPANY  ER schema is shown again in Figure 9.1, and the corresponding COMPANY  relational database schema is shown in Figure 9.2 to illustrate the\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 9.1 The ER conceptual schema diagram for the COMPANY database. 9.1 Relational Database Design Using ER-to-Relational Mapping  291 mapping steps. We assume that the mapping will create tables with simple single- valued attributes. The relational model constraints defined in Chapter 5, which include primary keys, unique keys (if any), and referential integrity constraints on the relations, will also be specified in the mapping results. Step 1: Mapping of Regular Entity Types.\n",
      "\n",
      "For each regular (strong) entity type E in the ER schema, create a relation R that includes all the simple attributes of E. Include only the simple component attributes of a composite attribute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Choose one of the key attributes of E as the primary key for R. If the chosen key of E is a com- posite, then the set of simple attributes that form it will together form the primary key of R. If multiple keys were identified for E during the conceptual design, the information describing the attributes that form each additional key is kept in order to specify additional (unique) keys of relation R. Knowledge about keys is also kept for index- ing purposes and other types of analyses.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our example, we create the relations EMPLOYEE , DEPARTMENT , and PROJECT  in Figure 9.2 to correspond to the regular entity types EMPLOYEE , DEPARTMENT , and PROJECT  from Figure 9.1. The foreign key and relationship attributes, if any, are not included yet; they will be added during subsequent steps. These include the attributes Super_ssn  and Dno of EMPLOYEE , Mgr_ssn  and Mgr_start_date  of DEPARTMENT , and Dnum  of PROJECT .\n",
      "\n",
      "In our example, we choose Ssn, Dnumber , and Pnumber  as primary keys for the relations EMPLOYEE , DEPARTMENT , and PROJECT , respectively. Knowledge that Dname  of DEPARTMENT  and Pname  of PROJECT  are unique keys is kept for possible use later in the design. The relations that are created from the mapping of entity types are sometimes called entity relations  because each tuple represents an entity instance. The result after this mapping step is shown in Figure 9.3(a). Step 2: Mapping of Weak Entity Types.\n",
      "\n",
      "For each weak entity type W in the ER schema with owner entity type E, create a relation R and include all simple attributes (or simple components of composite attributes) of W as attributes of R. In addition, include as foreign key attributes of R, the primary key attribute(s) of the relation(s) that correspond to the owner entity type(s); this takes care of mapping the identifying relationship type of W. The primary key of R is the combination of the primary key(s) of the owner(s) and the partial key of the weak entity type W, if any.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there is a weak entity type E 2 whose owner is also a weak entity type E1, then E1 should be mapped before E2 to determine its primary key first. In our example, we create the relation DEPENDENT  in this step to correspond to the weak entity type DEPENDENT  (see Figure 9.3(b)).\n",
      "\n",
      "We include the primary key Ssn of the EMPLOYEE  relation—which corresponds to the owner entity type— as a foreign key attribute of DEPENDENT ; we rename it Essn , although this is not The primary key of the DEPENDENT  relation is the combination { Essn , Dependent_name }, because Dependent_name  (also renamed from Name  in Figure 9.1) is the partial key of DEPENDENT .\n",
      "\n",
      "It is common to choose the propagate ( CASCADE ) option for the referential trig- gered action (see Section 6.2) on the foreign key in the relation corresponding to the weak entity type, since a weak entity has an existence dependency on its owner entity. This can be used for both ON UPDATE  and ON DELETE . Step 3: Mapping of Binary 1:1 Relationship Types.\n",
      "\n",
      "For each binary 1:1 rela- tionship type R in the ER schema, identify the relations S and T that correspond to the entity types participating in R. There are three possible approaches: (1) the foreign key approach, (2) the merged relationship approach, and (3) the cross- reference or relationship relation approach. The first approach is the most useful and should be followed unless special conditions exist, as we discuss below. 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign key approach:  Choose one of the relations— S, say—and include as a foreign key in S the primary key of T. It is better to choose an entity type with total participation  in R in the role of S. Include all the simple attributes (or simple components of composite attributes) of the 1:1 relationship type R as attributes of S. In our example, we map the 1:1 relationship type MANAGES  from Figure 9.1 by choosing the participating entity type DEPARTMENT  to serve in the role of S because its participation in the MANAGES  relationship type is total (every department has a manager).\n",
      "\n",
      "We include the primary key of the EMPLOYEE  relation as foreign key in the DEPARTMENT  relation and rename it to Mgr_ssn . We also include the simple attribute Start_date  of the MANAGES relationship type in the DEPARTMENT  relation and rename it Mgr_start_date (see Figure 9.2 ). Note that it is possible to include the primary key of S as a foreign key in T instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our example, this amounts to having a foreign key attribute, say Department_managed  in the EMPLOYEE  relation, but it will have a NULL  value for employee tuples who do not manage a department. This would be a bad choice, because if only 2% of employees manage a department, then 98% of the foreign keys would be NULL  in this case. Another possibility is to have foreign keys in both relations S and T redundantly, but this creates redun- dancy and incurs a penalty for consistency maintenance. 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Merged relation approach:  An alternative mapping of a 1:1 relationship type is to merge the two entity types and the relationship into a single rela- tion. This is possible when both participations are total,  as this would indi- cate that the two tables will have the exact same number of tuples at all times. 3. Cross-reference or relationship relation approach:  The third option is to set up a third relation R for the purpose of cross-referencing the primary keys of the two relations S and T representing the entity types.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we will see, this approach is required for binary M:N relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "The relation R is called a relationship relation  (or sometimes a lookup table ), because each 294 Chapter 9 Relational Database Design by ER- and EER-to-Relational Mapping tuple in R represents a relationship instance that relates one tuple from S with one tuple from T. The relation R will include the primary key attributes of S and T as foreign keys to S and T. The primary key of R will be one of the two foreign keys, and the other foreign key will be a unique key of R. The drawback is having an extra relation, and requiring extra join operations when combining related tuples from the tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 4: Mapping of Binary 1:N Relationship Types. There are two possible approaches: (1) the foreign key approach and (2) the cross-reference or relationship relation approach. The first approach is generally preferred as it reduces the num- ber of tables. 1. The foreign key approach:  For each regular binary 1:N relationship type R, identify the relation S that represents the participating entity type at the N-side  of the relationship type.\n",
      "\n",
      "Include as foreign key in S the primary key of the relation T that represents the other entity type participating in R; we do this because each entity instance on the N-side is related to at most one entity instance on the 1-side of the relationship type. Include any simple attributes (or simple components of composite attributes) of the 1:N rela-tionship type as attributes of S. To apply this approach to our example, we map the 1:N relationship types WORKS_FOR , CONTROLS , and SUPERVISION  from Figure 9.1.\n",
      "\n",
      "For WORKS_FOR  we include the primary key Dnumber  of the DEPARTMENT  relation as foreign key in the EMPLOYEE  relation and call it Dno. For SUPERVISION  we include the primary key of the EMPLOYEE  relation as foreign key in the EMPLOYEE  relation itself—because the relationship is recursive—and call it Super_ssn .\n",
      "\n",
      "The CONTROLS  relationship is mapped to the foreign key attri- bute Dnum  of PROJECT , which references the primary key Dnumber  of the DEPARTMENT  relation. These foreign keys are shown in Figure 9.2. 2. The relationship relation approach:  An alternative approach is to use the relationship relation  (cross-reference) option as in the third option for binary 1:1 relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "We create a separate relation R whose attributes are the primary keys of S and T, which will also be foreign keys to S and T. The primary key of R is the same as the primary key of S. This option can be used if few tuples in S participate in the relationship to avoid excessive NULL  val- ues in the foreign key. Step 5: Mapping of Binary M:N Relationship Types. In the traditional rela- tional model with no multivalued attributes, the only option for M:N relationships is the relationship relation (cross-reference) option .\n",
      "\n",
      "For each binary M:N rela- tionship type R, create a new relation S to represent R. Include as foreign key attri- butes in S the primary keys of the relations that represent the participating entity types; their combination  will form the primary key of S. Also include any simple attributes of the M:N relationship type (or simple components of composite attri-butes) as attributes of S. Notice that we cannot represent an M:N relationship type by a single foreign key attribute in one of the participating relations (as we did for  9.1 Relational Database Design Using ER-to-Relational Mapping  295 1:1 or 1:N relationship types) because of the M:N cardinality ratio; we must create a separate relationship relation S .\n",
      "\n",
      "In our example, we map the M:N relationship type WORKS_ON  from Figure 9.1 by creating the relation WORKS_ON  in Figure 9.2. We include the primary keys of the PROJECT  and EMPLOYEE  relations as foreign keys in WORKS_ON  and rename them Pno and Essn , respectively (renaming is not required;  it is a design choice). We also include an attribute Hours  in WORKS_ON  to represent the Hours  attribute of the relationship type.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary key of the WORKS_ON  relation is the combi- nation of the foreign key attributes { Essn , Pno}. This relationship relation  is shown in Figure 9.3(c). The propagate ( CASCADE ) option for the referential triggered action (see Sec- tion 4.2) should be specified on the foreign keys in the relation corresponding to the relationship R, since each relationship instance has an existence dependency on each of the entities it relates. This can be used for both ON UPDATE  and ON DELETE .\n",
      "\n",
      "Although we can map 1:1 or 1:N relationships in a manner similar to M:N relation- ships by using the cross-reference (relationship relation) approach, as we discussed earlier, this is only recommended when few relationship instances exist, in order to avoid NULL  values in foreign keys. In this case, the primary key of the relationship relation will be only one  of the foreign keys that reference the participating entity relations. For a 1:N relationship, the primary key of the relationship relation will be the foreign key that references the entity relation on the N-side.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a 1:1 relation- ship, either foreign key can be used as the primary key of the relationship relation. Step 6: Mapping of Multivalued Attributes. For each multivalued attribute A, create a new relation R. This relation R will include an attribute corresponding to A, plus the primary key attribute K—as a foreign key in R—of the relation that repre- sents the entity type or relationship type that has A as a multivalued attribute.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary key of R is the combination of A and K. If the multivalued attribute is com- posite, we include its simple components. In our example, we create a relation DEPT_LOCATIONS  (see Figure 9.3(d)). The attribute Dlocation  represents the multivalued attribute LOCATIONS  of DEPARTMENT , whereas Dnumber —as foreign key—represents the primary key of the DEPARTMENT  relation. The primary key of DEPT_LOCATIONS  is the combination of {Dnumber , Dlocation }.\n",
      "\n",
      "A separate tuple will exist in DEPT_LOCATIONS  for each loca- tion that a department has. It is important to note that in more recent versions of the relational model that allow array data types, the multivalued attribute can be mapped to an array attribute rather than requiring a separate table. The propagate ( CASCADE ) option for the referential triggered action (see Sec- tion 6.2) should be specified on the foreign key in the relation R corresponding to the multivalued attribute for both ON UPDATE  and ON DELETE .\n",
      "\n",
      "We should also note that the key of R when mapping a composite, multivalued attribute requires some analysis of the meaning of the component attributes. In some cases, when a multi- valued attribute is composite, only some of the component attributes are required 296 Chapter 9 Relational Database Design by ER- and EER-to-Relational Mapping to be part of the key of R; these attributes are similar to a partial key of a weak entity type that corresponds to the multivalued attribute (see Section 3.5).\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 9.2 shows the COMPANY  relational database schema obtained with steps 1 through 6, and Figure 5.6 shows a sample database state. Notice that we did not yet discuss the mapping of n-ary relationship types ( n > 2) because none exist in Fig- ure 9.1 ; these are mapped in a similar way to M:N relationship types by including the following additional step in the mapping algorithm. Step 7: Mapping of N-ary Relationship Types. We use the relationship relation option .\n",

      "\n",
      "For example, in a computer system where the Oracle RDBMS is installed, the com-mand SQLPLUS  starts the interactive interface. The user can type SQL commands or queries directly over several lines, ended by a semicolon and the Enter key (that is, \";<cr>\" ). Alternatively, a file of commands  can be created and executed through the interactive interface by typing @<filename >. The system will execute the commands written in the file and display the results, if any. The interactive interface is quite convenient for schema and constraint creation or for occasional ad hoc queries.\n",

      "However, in practice, the majority of database inter-actions are executed through programs that have been carefully designed and tested. These programs are generally known as application programs  or database applications , and are used as canned transactions  by the end users, as discussed in Section 1.4.3. Another common use of database programming is to access a data-base through an application program that implements a Web interface , for exam- ple, when making airline reservations or online purchases. In fact, the vast majority of Web electronic commerce applications include some database access commands.\n",

In this section, first we give an overview of the main approaches to database pro- gramming. Then we discuss some of the problems that occur when trying to access a database from a general-purpose programming language, and the typical sequence of commands for interacting with a database from a software program.\n",
      "\n",
      "10.1.1 Approaches to Database Programming Several techniques exist for including database interactions in application pro-grams. The main approaches for database programming are the following: 1. Embedding database commands in a general-purpose programming  language. In this approach, database statements are embedded  into the host programming language, but they are identified by a special prefix.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the prefix for embedded SQL is the string EXEC SQL , which pre- cedes all SQL commands in a host language program.1 A precompiler  or preproccessor  scans the source program code to identify database state- ments and extract them for processing by the DBMS. They are replaced in the program by function calls to the DBMS-generated code. This technique is generally referred to as embedded SQL . 2. Using a library of database functions or classes. A library of functions is made available to the host programming language for database calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, there could be functions to connect to a database, prepare a query, execute a query, execute an update, loop over the query result on record at a time, and so on. The actual database query and update commands and any 1Other prefixes are sometimes used, but this is the most common.312 Chapter 10 Introduction to SQL Programming Techniques other necessary information are included as parameters in the function calls. This approach provides what is known as an application programming interface  (API ) for accessing a database from application programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "For object-oriented programming languages (OOPLs), a class library  is used. For example, Java has the JDBC class library, which can generate various types of objects such as: connection objects to a particular database, query objects, and query result objects. Each type of object has a set of operations associated with the class corresponding to the object. 3. Designing a brand-new language. A database programming language  is designed from scratch to be compatible with the database model and query language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional programming structures such as loops and conditional statements are added to the database language to convert it into a full-fledged programming language. An example of this approach is Oracle’s PL/SQL. The SQL standard has the SQL/PSM language for specifying stored procedures. In practice, the first two approaches are more common, since many applications are already written in general-purpose programming languages but require some database access. The third approach is more appropriate for applications that have intensive database interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the main problems with the first two approaches is impedance mismatch , which does not occur in the third approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "10.1.2 Impedance Mismatch Impedance mismatch  is the term used to refer to the problems that occur because of differences between the database model and the programming language model. For example, the practical relational model has three main constructs: columns (attributes) and their data types, rows (also referred to as tuples or records), and tables (sets or multisets of records). The first problem that may occur is that the data types of the programming language  differ from the attribute data types  that are available in the data model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, it is necessary to have a binding  for each host programming language that specifies for each attribute type the compatible pro- gramming language types. A different binding is needed for each programming lan- guage  because different languages have different data types. For example, the data types available in C/C++ and Java are different, and both differ from the SQL data types, which are the standard data types for relational databases. Another problem occurs because the results of most queries are sets or multisets of tuples (rows), and each tuple is formed of a sequence of attribute values.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the pro-gram, it is often necessary to access the individual data values within individual tuples for printing or processing. Hence, a binding is needed to map the query result data structure , which is a table, to an appropriate data structure in the program- ming language. A mechanism is needed to loop over the tuples in a query result  in order to access a single tuple at a time and to extract individual values from the tuple. The extracted attribute values are typically copied to appropriate program variables for further processing by the program.\n",
      "\n",
      "A cursor  or iterator variable  is typically used to loop over the tuples in a query result. Individual values within each tuple are then extracted into distinct program variables of the appropriate type. 10.1 Overview of Database Programming Techniques and Issues  313 Impedance mismatch is less of a problem when a special database programming language is designed that uses the same data model and data types as the database model. One example of such a language is Oracle’s PL/SQL.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SQL standard also has a proposal for such a database programming language, known as SQL/PSM . For object databases, the object data model (see Chapter 12) is quite similar to the data model of the Java programming language, so the impedance mismatch is greatly reduced when Java is used as the host language for accessing a Java-compatible object database. Several database programming languages have been implemented as research prototypes (see the Selected Bibliography).\n",

      "10.1.3  Typical Sequence of Interaction in Database Programming When a programmer or software engineer writes a program that requires access to a database, it is quite common for the program to be running on one computer system while the database is installed on another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recall from Section 2.5 that a common architecture for database access is the three-tier client/server model, where a top-tier client program  handles display of information on a laptop or mobile device usually as a Web client or mobile app, a middle-tier application program  implements the logic of a business software application but includes some calls to one or more database servers  at the bottom tier to access or update the data. 2 When writing such an application program, a common sequence of interac- tion is the following: 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the application program requires access to a particular database, the program must first establish  or open  a connection  to the database server. Typically, this involves specifying the Internet address (URL) of the machine where the database server is located, plus providing a login account name and password for database access. 2. Once the connection is established, the program can interact with the database by submitting queries, updates, and other database commands. In general, most types of SQL statements can be included in an application program. 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the program no longer needs access to a particular database, it should terminate  or close  the connection to the database. A program can access multiple databases if needed. In some database programming approaches, only one connection can be active at a time, whereas in other approaches multiple connections can be established simultaneously. In the next three sections, we discuss examples of each of the three main approaches to database programming. Section 10.2 describes how SQL is embedded  into a pro- gramming language.\n",

      "10.2 Embedded SQL, Dynamic SQL, and SQL J   In this section, we give an overview of the techniques for embedding SQL state-ments in a general-purpose programming language. We focus on two languages: C and Java. The examples used with the C language, known as embedded SQL , are presented in Sections 10.2.1 through 10.2.3, and can be adapted to other similar programming languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "The examples using Java, known as SQLJ , are presented in Sections 10.2.4 and 10.2.5. In this embedded approach, the programming lan-guage is called the host language . Most SQL statements—including data or con- straint definitions, queries, updates, or view definitions—can be embedded in a host language program.\n",
      "\n",
      "10.2.1 Retrieving Single Tuples with Embedded SQL To illustrate the concepts of embedded SQL, we will use C as the host programming language. 4 In a C program, an embedded SQL statement is distinguished from pro- gramming language statements by prefixing it with the keywords EXEC SQL  so that a preprocessor  (or precompiler ) can separate embedded SQL statements from the host language source code. The SQL statements within a program are terminated by a matching END-EXEC  or by a semicolon (;). Similar rules apply to embedding SQL in other programming languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within an embedded SQL command, the programmer can refer to specially declared C program variables; these are called shared variables  because they are used in both the C program and the embedded SQL statements. Shared variables are prefixed by a colon (:) when they appear in an SQL statement . This distin- guishes program variable names from the names of database schema constructs such as attributes (column names) and relations (table names). It also allows pro-gram variables to have the same names as attribute names, since they are distin-guishable by the colon (:) prefix in the SQL statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Names of database schema constructs—such as attributes and relations—can only be used within the SQL commands, but shared program variables can be used elsewhere in the C program without the colon (:) prefix. Suppose that we want to write C programs to process the COMPANY  database in Figure 5.5. We need to declare program variables to match the types of the database attributes that the program will process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The programmer can choose the names of the program variables ; they may or may not have names that are identical to their 3SQL/PSM illustrates how typical general-purpose programming language constructs—such as loops and conditional structures—can be incorporated into SQL. 4Our discussion here also applies to the C++ or C# programming languages, since we do not use any of the object-oriented features, but focus on the database programming mechanism. 10.2 Embedded SQL, Dynamic SQL, and SQL J  315 corresponding database attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will use the C program variables declared in Figure 10.1 for all our examples and show C program segments without vari- able declarations . Shared variables are declared within a declare section  in the program, as shown in Figure 10.1 (lines 1 through 7).5 A few of the common bindings of C types to SQL types are as follows. The SQL types INTEGER , SMALLINT , REAL , and DOUBLE  are mapped to the C data types long , short , float , and double , respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fixed-length and varying-length strings ( CHAR [ i], VARCHAR [ i]) in SQL can be mapped to arrays of characters ( char [i+1], varchar [i+1] ) in C that are one character longer than the SQL type because strings in C are terminated by a NULL  character ( \\0), which is not part of the character string itself.6 Although varchar  is not a standard C data type, it is per- mitted when C is used for SQL database programming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that the only embedded SQL commands in Figure 10.1 are lines 1 and 7, which tell the precompiler to take note of the C variable names between BEGIN DECLARE  and END DECLARE  because they can be included in embedded SQL state- ments—as long as they are preceded by a colon (:). Lines 2 through 5 are regular C program declarations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The C program variables declared in lines 2 through 5 cor-respond to the attributes of the EMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT  tables from the COMPANY  database in Figure 5.5 that was declared by the SQL DDL  in Figure 6.1. The variables declared in line 6— SQLCODE  and SQLSTATE —are called SQL communication variables;  they are used to communicate errors and exception conditions between the database system and the executing program.\n",

Communication variables SQLCODE and SQLSTATE.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two special communication variables  that are used by the DBMS to communicate exception or error conditions to the program are SQLCODE  and SQLSTATE . The SQLCODE variable shown in Figure 10.1 is an integer variable. After each database command is executed, the DBMS returns a value in SQLCODE . A value of 0 indicates that the statement was executed successfully by the DBMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "If SQLCODE  > 0 (or, more spe- cifically, if SQLCODE  = 100), this indicates that no more data (records) are available in a query result. If SQLCODE  < 0, this indicates some error has occurred. In some systems—for example, in the Oracle RDBMS— SQLCODE  is a field in a record structure called SQLCA  (SQL communication area), so it is referenced as SQLCA.SQLCODE .\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, the definition of SQLCA  must be included in the C program by including the following line: EXEC SQL include SQLCA ; In later versions of the SQL standard, a communication variable called SQLSTATE was added, which is a string of five characters. A value of ‘00000’ in SQLSTATE  indi- cates no error or exception; other values indicate various errors or exceptions. For example, ‘02000’ indicates ‘no more data’ when using SQLSTATE . Currently, both SQLSTATE  and SQLCODE  are available in the SQL standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the error and exception codes returned in SQLSTATE  are supposed to be standardized for all SQL vendors and platforms,7 whereas the codes returned in SQLCODE  are not stan- dardized but are defined by the DBMS vendor. Hence, it is generally better to use SQLSTATE  because this makes error handling in the application programs indepen- dent of a particular DBMS. As an exercise, the reader should rewrite the examples given later in this chapter using SQLSTATE  instead of SQLCODE . Example of Embedded SQL Programming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our first example to illustrate embedded SQL programming is a repeating program segment (loop) that takes as input a Social Security number of an employee and prints some information from the corresponding EMPLOYEE  record in the database. The C program code is shown as program segment E1 in Figure 10.2.

C program variables in the INTO  clause are prefixed with a colon ( :), as we discussed earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "The INTO  clause can be used in this manner only when the query result is a single record ; if multiple records are retrieved, an error will be generated. We will see how multiple records are handled in Section 10.2.2. Line 7 in E1 illustrates the communication between the database and the program through the special variable SQLCODE . If the value returned by the DBMS in SQLCODE  is 0, the previous statement was executed without errors or exception conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Line 7 checks this and assumes that if an error occurred, it was because no EMPLOYEE  tuple existed with the given Ssn; therefore it outputs a message to that effect (line 8). When a single record is retrieved as in example E1, the programmer can assign its attribute values directly to C program variables in the INTO  clause, as in line 5. In general, an SQL query can retrieve many tuples. In that case, the C program will typically loop through the retrieved tuples and process them one at a time.\n",

It is used to loop over the query result, one record at a time. The cursor is declared when the SQL query is declared . Later in the pro- gram, an OPEN CURSOR  command fetches the query result from the database and sets the cursor to a position before the first row  in the result of the query.\n",

      "The cursor variable is basically an iterator  that iterates (loops) over the tuples in the query result—one tuple at a time. To determine when all the tuples in the result of the query have been processed, the communication variable SQLCODE  (or, alternatively, SQLSTATE ) is checked.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a FETCH  command is issued that results in moving the cursor past the last tuple in the result of the query, a positive value ( SQLCODE  > 0) is returned in SQLCODE , indicating that no data (tuple) was found (or the string ‘02000’ is returned in SQLSTATE ). The programmer uses this to terminate the loop over the tuples in the query result. In general, numerous cursors can be opened at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "A CLOSE CURSOR  command is issued to indicate that we are done with processing the result of the query associated with that cursor. An example of using cursors to process a query result with multiple records is shown in Figure 10.3, where a cursor called EMP  is declared in line 4.

      "A fetch orientation  can be added to the FETCH  command, whose value can be one of NEXT , PRIOR , FIRST , LAST , ABSOLUTE  i, and RELATIVE  i. In the latter two commands, i must evaluate to an integer value that specifies an absolute tuple position within the query result (for ABSOLUTE  i), or a tuple position relative to the current cursor position (for RELATIVE  i). The default fetch orientation, which we used in our examples, is NEXT .\n",

It is specified in a similar manner to the corresponding clause for SQL queries (see Section 6.3.6).\n",

      "10.2.3 Specifying Queries at Runtime Using Dynamic SQL In the previous examples, the embedded SQL queries were written as part of the host program source code. Hence, anytime we want to write a different query, we must modify the program code and go through all the steps involved (compiling, debugging, testing, and so on). In some cases, it is convenient to write a program that can execute different SQL queries or updates (or other operations) dynamically at runtime .\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we may want to write a program that accepts an SQL query typed from the monitor, executes it, and displays its result, such as the inter-active interfaces available for most relational DBMSs. Another example is when a user-friendly interface generates SQL queries dynamically for the user based on user input through a Web interface or mobile App. In this section, we give a brief overview of dynamic SQL , which is one technique for writing this type of database program, by giving a simple example to illustrate how dynamic SQL can work.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Section 10.3, we will describe another approach for dealing with dynamic queries using function libraries or class libraries. Program segment E3 in Figure 10.4 reads a string that is input by the user (that string should be an SQL update command  in this example) into the string program variable sqlupdatestring  in line 3. It then prepares  this as an SQL command in line 4 by associating it with the SQL variable sqlcommand . Line 5 then executes the command.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that in this case no syntax check or other types of checks on the command are possible at compile time , since the SQL command is not available until runtime. This contrasts with our previous examples of embedded SQL, where the query could be checked at compile time because its text was in the program source code. In E3, the reason for separating PREPARE  and EXECUTE  is that if the command is to be executed multiple times in a program, it can be prepared only once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Preparing the command  generally involves syntax and other types of checks by the system, as //Program Segment E3: 0) EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION ;1) varchar sqlupdatestring [256] ;2) EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION ; ... 3) prompt(\"Enter the Update Command: \", sqlupdatestring) ;4) EXEC SQL PREPARE sqlcommand FROM :sqlupdatestring ;5) EXEC SQL EXECUTE sqlcommand ; ...Figure 10.4 Program segment E3, a C program segment that uses dynamic SQL for updating a table.\n",

It is possible to combine the PREPARE and EXECUTE  commands (lines 4 and 5 in E3) into a single statement by writing EXEC SQL EXECUTE IMMEDIATE :sqlupdatestring ; This is useful if the command is to be executed only once. Alternatively, the pro-grammer can separate the two statements to catch any errors after the PREPARE statement as in E3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although including a dynamic update command  is relatively straightforward in dynamic SQL, a dynamic retrieval query  is much more complicated. This is because the programmer does not know the types or the number of attributes to be retrieved by the SQL query when writing the program. A complex data structure is needed to allow for different numbers and types of attributes in the query result if no prior information is known about the dynamic query. Techniques similar to those that we shall discuss in Section 10.3 can be used to assign retrieval query results (and query parameters) to host program variables.\n",

SQLJ is a stan- dard that has been adopted by several vendors for embedding SQL in Java.\n",

Hence, it is necessary to install a JDBC driver when using SQLJ.\n",

This plays a similar role to SQLCODE  and SQLSTATE  in embedded SQL. Java has many types of predefined exceptions. Each Java operation (function) must specify the exceptions that can be thrown —that is, the exception conditions that may occur while executing the Java code of that operation. If a defined exception occurs, the system transfers control to the Java code specified for exception handling.\n",

However, looping over a query result is different for the two types of iterators. First, we show an example of using a named  iterator in Figure 10.8, program segment J2A.\n",
      "\n",
      "Line 9 in Figure 10.8 shows how a named itera- tor type  Emp is declared. Notice that the names of the attributes in a named iterator type must match the names of the attributes in the SQL query result. Line 10 shows how an iterator object e of type Emp is created in the program and then associated with a query (lines 11 and 12).\n",
      "\n",
      "When the iterator object is associated with a query (lines 11 and 12 in Figure 10.8), the program fetches the query result from the database and sets the iterator to a position before the first row  in the result of the query. This becomes the current row for the iterator. Subsequently, next  operations are issued on the iterator object; each next  moves the iterator to the next row  in the result of the query, making it the current row. If the row exists, the operation retrieves the attribute values for that row into the corresponding program variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "If no more rows exist, the next operation returns NULL , and can thus be used to control the looping. Notice that the named iterator does not need  an INTO  clause, because the program variables corre- sponding to the retrieved attributes are already specified when the iterator type is declared (line 9 in Figure 10.8). In Figure 10.8, the command (e.next())  in line 13 performs two functions: It gets the next tuple in the query result and controls the WHILE  loop.\n",

The main difference between this and the named iterator is that there are no attribute names (corresponding to program variable names) in the positional iterator—only attribute types. This can provide more flexibility, but it makes the processing of the query result slightly more complex.\n",

      "10.3  Database Programming with Function   Calls and Class Libraries: SQL/CLI  and JDBC Embedded SQL (see Section 10.2) is sometimes referred to as a static  database pro- gramming approach because the query text is written within the program source code and cannot be changed without recompiling or reprocessing the source code. The use of function calls is a more dynamic  approach for database programming than embedded SQL. We already saw one dynamic database programming technique—dynamic SQL—in Section 10.2.3.\n",
      "\n",
      "The techniques discussed here provide another approach to dynamic database programming. A library of functions , also known as an application programming interface  (API ), is used to access the database. Although this provides more flexibility because no preprocessor is needed, one drawback is that syntax and other checks on SQL commands have to be done at runtime. Another drawback is that it sometimes requires more complex program-ming to access query results because the types and numbers of attributes in a query result may not be known in advance. In this section, we give an overview of two function call interfaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "We first discuss the SQL Call Level Interface (SQL/CLI ), which is part of the SQL standard. This was developed as a standardization of the popular library of functions known as ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) . We use C as the host language in our SQL/CLI examples. Then we give an overview of JDBC , which is the call function interface for accessing databases from Java. Although it is commonly assumed that JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity, JDBC is just a registered trademark of Sun Microsystems (now Oracle), not an acronym.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main advantage of using a function call interface is that it makes it easier to access multiple databases within the same application program, even if they are stored under different DBMS packages. We discuss this further in Sec- tion 10.3.2 when we discuss Java database programming with JDBC, although this advantage also applies to database programming with SQL/CLI and ODBC (see Section 10.3.1).\n",
      "\n",
      "10.3.1  Database Programming with SQL/CLI Using C as the Host Language Before using the function calls in SQL/CLI, it is necessary to install the appropriate library packages on the database server. These packages are obtained from the ven-dor of the DBMS being used. We now give an overview of how SQL/CLI can be used in a C program. 13 We will illustrate our presentation with the sample program segment CLI1 shown in Figure 10.10.\n",

When using SQL/CLI, the SQL statements are dynamically created and passed as string parameters  in the function calls.\n",

The information is kept in four types of records, represented as structs  in C data types. An environment record  is used as a container to keep track of one or more data- base connections and to set environment information. A connection record  keeps track of the information needed for a particular database connection. A statement record  keeps track of the information needed for one SQL statement.\n",

Hence, different data source accesses within the same Java program may require JDBC drivers from different vendors. To achieve this flexibil-ity, a special JDBC class called the driver manager  class is employed, which keeps track of the installed drivers.\n",

      "There is a generic function execute  in JDBC, plus two specialized functions: executeUpdate  and executeQuery . executeUpdate  is used for SQL insert, delete, or update statements, and returns an integer value indicating the number of tuples that were affected. executeQuery  is used for SQL retrieval statements, and returns an object of type ResultSet , which we discuss next. 9. Processing the ResultSet  object. In line 19, the result of the query is returned in an object  r of type ResultSet .\n",

      "This resembles a two-dimensional array or a table, where the tuples are the rows and the attributes returned are the columns. A ResultSet  object is similar to a cursor in embedded SQL and an iterator in SQLJ. In our example, when the query is executed, r refers to a tuple before the first tuple in the query result. The r.next()  function (line 20) moves to the next tuple (row) in the ResultSet  object and returns NULL  if there are no more objects. This is used to control the looping.\n",

Notice that JDBC does not distinguish between queries that return single tuples and those that return multiple tuples, unlike some of the other techniques.

In Section 10.4.1, we discuss the concept of stored procedures, which are program modules that are stored by the DBMS at the database server. Then in Section 10.4.2 we discuss the extensions to SQL that are specified in the standard to include general-purpose programming constructs in SQL.\n",
      "\n",
      "These extensions are known as SQL/PSM (SQL/Persistent Stored Modules) and can be used to write stored proce- dures. SQL/PSM also serves as an example of a database programming language that extends a database model and language—namely, SQL—with programming language constructs, such as conditional statements and loops.\n",
      "\n",
      "10.4.1 Database Stored Procedures and Functions In our presentation of database programming techniques so far, there was an implicit assumption that the database application program was running on a client 336 Chapter 10 Introduction to SQL Programming Techniques machine, or more likely at the application server computer  in the middle-tier of a three-tier client-server architecture (see Section 2.5.4 and Figure 2.7).\n",
      "\n",
      "In either case, the machine where the program is executing is different from the machine on which the database server—and the main part of the DBMS software package—is located. Although this is suitable for many applications, it is sometimes useful to create database program modules—procedures or functions—that are stored and exe-cuted by the DBMS at the database server. These are historically known as database stored procedures , although they can be functions or procedures.\n",
      "\n",
      "The term used in the SQL standard for stored procedures is persistent stored modules  because these programs are stored persistently by the DBMS, similarly to the persistent data stored by the DBMS. Stored procedures are useful in the following circumstances: ■If a database program is needed by several applications, it can be stored at the server and invoked by any of the application programs. This reduces duplication of effort and improves software modularity. ■Executing a program at the server can reduce data transfer and communica- tion cost between the client and server in certain situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "■These procedures can enhance the modeling power provided by views by allowing more complex types of derived data to be made available to the database users via the stored procedures. Additionally, they can be used to check for complex constraints that are beyond the specification power of assertions and triggers. In general, many commercial DBMSs allow stored procedures and functions to be written in a general-purpose programming language. Alternatively, a stored proce- dure can be made of simple SQL commands such as retrievals and updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The general form of declaring stored procedures is as follows: CREATE PROCEDURE  <procedure name> (<parameters>) <local declarations> <procedure body> ; The parameters and local declarations are optional, and are specified only if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "For declaring a function, a return type is necessary, so the declaration form is: CREATE FUNCTION  <function name> (<parameters>) RETURNS  <return type> <local declarations> <function body> ; If the procedure (or function) is written in a general-purpose programming language, it is typical to specify the language as well as a file name where the program code is stored.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the following format can be used: CREATE PROCEDURE  <procedure name> (<parameters>) LANGUAGE  <programming language name> EXTERNAL NAME  <file path name> ; 10.4 Database Stored Procedures and SQL/PSM  337 In general, each parameter should have a parameter type  that is one of the SQL data types. Each parameter should also have a parameter mode , which is one of IN, OUT , or INOUT .\n",
      "\n",
      "These correspond to parameters whose values are input only, out- put (returned) only, or both input and output, respectively. Because the procedures and functions are stored persistently by the DBMS, it should be possible to call them from the various SQL interfaces and programming techniques. The CALL  statement  in the SQL standard can be used to invoke a stored procedure—either from an interactive interface or from embedded SQL or SQLJ.\n",
      "\n",
      "The format of the statement is as follows: CALL  <procedure or function name> (<argument list>) ; If this statement is called from JDBC, it should be assigned to a statement object of type CallableStatement  (see Section 10.3.2).\n",

      "10.4.2  SQL/PSM: Extending SQL for Specifying Persistent Stored Modules SQL/PSM is the part of the SQL standard that specifies how to write persistent stored modules. It includes the statements to create functions and procedures that we described in the previous section. It also includes additional programming con-structs to enhance the power of SQL for the purpose of writing the code (or body) of stored procedures and functions. In this section, we discuss the SQL/PSM constructs for conditional (branching) statements and for looping statements.\n",

The function returns a string value (line 1) describing the size of a department within a company based on the number of employees.\n",

Embedded SQL Approach. The main advantage of this approach is that the query text is part of the program source code itself, and hence can be checked for syntax errors and validated against the database schema at compile time.\n",

The main disadvantages are the loss of flexibility in changing the query at runtime, and the fact that all changes to queries must go through the whole recompilation process. In addition, because the que-ries are known beforehand, the choice of program variables to hold the query results is a simple task, and so the programming of the application is generally easier. However, for complex applications where queries have to be generated at runtime, the function call approach will be more suitable. 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Library of Classes and Function Calls Approach. This approach provides more flexibility in that queries can be generated at runtime if needed. How-ever, this leads to more complex programming, as program variables that match the columns in the query result may not be known in advance. Because queries are passed as statement strings within the function calls, no checking can be done at compile time. All syntax checking and query valida-tion has to be done at runtime by preparing the query, and the programmer must check and account for possible additional runtime errors within the program code. 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "Database Programming Language Approach. This approach does not suf- fer from the impedance mismatch problem, as the programming language data types are the same as the database data types. However, programmers must learn a new programming language rather than use a language they are already familiar with. In addition, some database programming languages are vendor-specific, whereas general-purpose programming languages can easily work with systems from multiple vendors.\n",

      "10.6 Summary   In this chapter we presented additional features of the SQL database language. In particular, we presented an overview of the most important techniques for database programming in Section 10.1. Then we discussed the various approaches to data- base application programming in Sections 10.2 to 10.4. In Section 10.2, we discussed the general technique known as embedded SQL, where the queries are part of the program source code.\n",

We presented an overview of embedded SQL, using the C programming language as host language in our examples. We also discussed the SQLJ technique for embedding SQL in Java programs. The concepts of cursor (for embedded SQL) and iterator (for SQLJ) were presented and illustrated by examples to show how they are used for looping over the tuples in a query result, and extracting the attribute value into program vari-ables for further processing.\n",

For computer platforms with other operating systems such as Windows, Linux, or Mac OS, the PHP interpreter can be downloaded from: http://www.php.net. As with other scripting languages, PHP is particularly suited for manipulation of text pages, and in particular for manipulating dynamic HTML pages at the Web server computer.\n",

PHP has libraries of functions for accessing databases stored under various types of relational database systems such as Oracle, MySQL, SQLServer, and any system that supports the ODBC standard (see Chapter 10). Under the three-tier architec-ture (see Chapter 2), the DBMS would reside at the bottom-tier database server .\n",

No other special characters are permitted. Variable names are case sensitive, and the first character cannot be a number. Variables are not typed. The values assigned to the variables determine their type. In fact, the same variable can change its type once a new value is assigned to it. Assignment is via the = operator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since PHP is directed toward text processing, there are several different types of string values. There are also many functions available for processing strings. We only discuss some basic properties of string values and variables here. Figure 11.2 illustrates some string values. There are three main ways to express strings and text: 1. Single-quoted strings. Enclose the string between single quotes, as in lines 0, 1, and 2. If a single quote is needed within the string, use the escape char-acter ( \\) (see line 2). 2.\n",

      "Double-quoted strings. Enclose strings between double quotes as in line 7. In this case, variable names appearing within the string  are replaced by the values that are currently stored in these variables. The interpreter identifies variable names within double-quoted strings by their initial character $ and replaces them with the value in the variable. This is known as interpolating variables  within strings. Interpolation does not occur in single-quoted strings. 3. Here documents.\n",

      "This is illustrated in lines 8 through 11 in Figure 11.2. Variables are also interpolated by replacing them with their string values if they appear inside here documents. This feature is used in a similar way to double-quoted strings, but it is more convenient for multiple-line text. 4. Single and double quotes. Single and double quotes used by PHP to enclose strings should be straight  quotes (\"\") on both sides of the string.\n",
      "\n",
      "The text editor that creates these quotes should not produce curly  opening and clos- ing quotes (“ ”) around the string. There is also a string concatenate operator specified by the period ( .) symbol, as illustrated in line 6 of Figure 11.2. There are many string functions. We only illus-trate a couple of them here. The function strtolower  changes the alphabetic char- acters in the string to all lowercase, whereas the function ucwords  capitalizes all the words in a string.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are illustrated in lines 4 and 5 in Figure 11.2. The general rule is to use single-quoted strings for literal strings that contain no PHP program variables and the other two types (double-quoted strings and here documents) when the values from variables need to be interpolated into the string. For large blocks of multiline text, the program should use the here documents  style for strings. PHP also has numeric data types for integers and floating points and generally fol- lows the rules of the C programming language for processing these types.\n",
      "\n",
      "Numbers can be formatted for printing into strings by specifying the number of digits that follow the decimal point. A variation of the print  function called printf  (print formatted) allows formatting of numbers within a string, as illustrated in line 3 of Figure 11.2. There are the standard programming language constructs of for-loops, while-loops, and conditional if-statements. They are generally similar to their C language coun- terparts. We will not discuss them here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, any value  evaluates to true if used as a Boolean expression except for  numeric zero ( 0) and blank string, which evalu- ate to false. There are also literal true and false values that can be assigned. The comparison operators also generally follow C language rules. They are == (equal), != (not equal), > (greater than), >= (greater than or equal), < (less than), and <= (less than or equal).\n",
      "\n",
      "11.2.2 PHP Arrays Arrays are very important in PHP, since they allow lists of elements. They are used frequently in forms that employ pull-down menus. A single-dimensional array is used to hold the list of choices in the pull-down menu. For database query results, two-dimensional arrays are used, with the first dimension representing rows  of a table and the second dimension representing columns  (attributes) within a row. There are two main types of arrays: numeric and associative. We discuss each of these in the context of single-dimensional arrays next.\n",
      "\n",
      "11.2 Overview of Basic Features of PHP  349 A numeric array  associates a numeric index (or position or sequence number) with each element in the array. Indexes are integer numbers that start at zero and grow incrementally. An element in the array is referenced through its index. An  associative array  provides pairs of (key => value) elements. The value of an element is referenced through its key, and all key values in a particular array must be unique.\n",
      "\n",
      "The element values can be strings or integers, or they can be arrays themselves, thus leading to higher dimensional arrays. Figure 11.3 gives two examples of array variables: $teaching  and $courses . The first array $teaching  is associative (see line 0 in Figure 11.3), and each element associates a course name (as key) with the name of the course instructor (as value). There are three elements in this array. Line 1 shows how the array may be updated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first command in line 1 assigns a new instructor to the course ‘Graphics’ by updating its value. Since the key value ‘Graphics’ already exists in the array, no new element is created but the existing value is updated. The second command creates a new element since the key value ‘Data Mining’ did not exist in the array before. New elements are added at the end of the array.

The newer version of PHP, PHP5, also has object-oriented features, but we will not discuss these here because we are focus-ing on the basics of PHP. Basic PHP functions can have arguments that are passed by value . Global variables can be accessed within functions. Standard scope rules apply to variables that appear within a function and within the code that calls the function.\n",

The values provided in the arguments are passed (copied) to the function arguments when the function is called. ■Return values of a function are placed after the RETURN  keyword. A function can return any type. In this example, it returns a string type. Two different strings can be returned in our example, depending on whether the $course key value provided exists in the array or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Scope rules for variable names apply as in other programming languages. Global variables outside of the function cannot be used unless they are referred to using the built-in PHP array $GLOBALS . Basically, $GLOBALS['abc']  will access the value in a global variable $abc  defined outside the function. Other- wise, variables appearing inside a function are local even if there is a global variable with the same name. The previous discussion gives a brief overview of PHP functions. Many details are not discussed since it is not our goal to present PHP in detail.\n",

This is the part of the URL address that comes after a backslash ( /) at the end of the URL. 11.3 Overview of PHP Database Programming  353 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'] . This provides the string that holds parame- ters in a URL after a question mark (?) at the end of the URL.

These and other entries in the $_SERVER  array are usually needed when creating the HTML file to be sent to the client for display.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another important PHP auto-global built-in array variable is called $_POST . This provides the programmer with input values submitted by the user through HTML forms specified in the HTML <INPUT>  tag and other similar tags. For example, in Figure 11.4, line 14, the variable $_POST['user_name']  provides the programmer with the value typed in by the user in the HTML form specified via the <INPUT>  tag on line 8 in Figure 11.4.\n",
      "\n",
      "The keys to this array are the names of the various input parameters provided via the form, for example by using the name  attribute of the HTML <INPUT>  tag as on line 8. When users enter data through forms, the data values are stored in this array.\n",

In general, the PHP programmer can check after every database call to determine whether the last database operation was successful or not, and terminate the program (using the die function) if it was not successful.\n",

Whenever a query or SQL statement is executed, the result of the query is assigned to a query variable, which is called $q in our example. Line 8 checks whether the query was executed successfully or not. The PHP PEAR DB library offers an alternative to having to check for errors after every database command.\n",
      "\n",

      "11.3.2  Collecting Data from Forms and Inserting Records It is common in database applications to collect information through HTML or other types of Web forms. For example, when purchasing an airline ticket or apply- ing for a credit card, the user has to enter personal information such as name, address, and phone number. This information is typically collected and stored in a database record on a database server.356 Chapter 11 Web Database Programming Using PHP Lines 10 through 12 in Figure 11.6 illustrate how this may be done.\n",

These would be accessible via the PHP auto-global array $_POST  as discussed at the end of Section 11.2.4.\n",

These are then inserted as a new employee record in the EMPLOYEE  table. This example also illustrates another feature of PEAR DB. It is common in some applications to create a unique record identifier for each new record inserted into the database.\n",

In our example, the field Emp_id  of the EMPLOYEE  table (see Figure 11.6, line 4) is created for this purpose.

      "\n",
      "The code for insert in lines 10 to 12 in Figure 11.6 may allow malicious strings to be entered that can alter the INSERT  command.

In this form of the $d->query()  function, there are two arguments. The first argument is the SQL statement, with one or more ?\n",

The Java environment has components that run on the server and other components that can run on the client machine. It also has standards for exchanging data objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "We briefly discuss some of these components here that are related to Web and database access. We already discussed JDBC and SQLJ in some detail in Chapter 10. Java Servlets. Servlets are Java objects that can reside on the Web server machine and manage interactions with the client. They can store information that was submitted by the client during a session, so that this information can be used to generate database queries. Servlet objects can also store query results so that parts of these results can be formatted as HTML and sent to the client for display.\n",
      "\n",
      "The servlet object can maintain all the information produced dur-ing a particular client interaction until the client session is terminated. Java Server Pages (JSP). This allows scripting at the server to produce dynamic Web pages to be sent at the client in a manner somewhat similar to PHP. However, it is associated with the Java language and the scripting can be combined with Java code. JavaScript. JavaScript is a scripting language that is different from the Java programming language and was developed separately. It is widely used in Web applications, and it can run on the client computer or on the server.\n",
      "\n",
      "Java Script Object Notation (JSON). This is a text-based representation of data objects, so that data can be formatted in JSON and exchanged between clients and servers over the Web in text format. It can be considered as an alter-native to XML (see Chapter 13) and represents objects using attribute-value pairs. JSON has also been adopted as the data model by some newer database systems known as NOSQL systems, such as MongoDB (see Chapter 24).\n",

      "11.5 Summary   In this chapter, we gave an overview of how to convert some structured data from databases into elements to be entered or displayed on a Web page. We focused on the PHP scripting language, which is becoming very popular for Web database pro-gramming. Section 11.1 presented some PHP basics for Web programming through a simple example. Section 11.2 gave some of the basics of the PHP language, includ-ing its array and string data types that are used extensively.\n",

      "12.1.1 Introduction to Object-Oriented Concepts and Features The term object-oriented —abbreviated OO or O-O —has its origins in OO pro- gramming languages, or OOPLs. Today OO concepts are applied in the areas of databases, software engineering, knowledge bases, artificial intelligence, and computer systems in general. OOPLs have their roots in the SIMULA language, which was proposed in the late 1960s.\n",
      "\n",
      "The programming language Smalltalk, developed at Xerox PARC 4 in the 1970s, was one of the first languages to explic- itly incorporate additional OO concepts, such as message passing and inheri-tance. It is known as a pure  OO programming language, meaning that it was explicitly designed to be object-oriented. This contrasts with hybrid  OO pro- gramming languages, which incorporate OO concepts into an already existing language.\n",
      "\n",
      "An example of the latter is C++, which incorporates OO concepts into the popular C programming language. An object  typically has two components: state (value) and behavior (operations). It can have a complex data structure  as well as specific operations  defined by the pro- grammer. 5 Objects in an OOPL exist only during program execution; therefore, they are called transient objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "An OO database can extend the existence of objects so that they are stored permanently in a database, and hence the objects become persistent objects  that exist beyond program termination and can be retrieved later and shared by other programs. In other words, OO databases store persistent objects permanently in secondary storage and allow the sharing of these objects among multiple programs and applications. This requires the incorporation of other well-known features of database management systems, such as indexing mechanisms to efficiently locate the objects, concurrency control to allow object sharing among concurrent programs, and recovery from failures.\n",
      "\n",
      "An OO database system will typically interface with one or more OO programming languages to provide persistent and shared object capabilities. The internal structure of an object in OOPLs includes the specification of instance variables , which hold the values that define the internal state of the object. An instance variable is similar to the concept of an attribute  in the relational model , 4Palo Alto Research Center, Palo Alto, California.\n",
      "\n",
      "5Objects have many other characteristics, as we discuss in the rest of this chapter.366 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases except that instance variables may be encapsulated within the object and thus are not necessarily visible to external users. Instance variables may also be of arbitrarily complex data types. Object-oriented systems allow definition of the operations or functions (behavior) that can be applied to objects of a particular type. In fact, some OO models insist that all operations a user can apply to an object must be pre-defined.\n",

      "This forces a complete encapsulation  of objects. This rigid approach has been relaxed in most OO data models for two reasons. First, database users often need to know the attribute names so they can specify selection conditions on the attributes to retrieve specific objects. Second, complete encapsulation implies that any simple retrieval requires a predefined operation, thus making ad hoc queries difficult to specify on the fly. To encourage encapsulation, an operation is defined in two parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first part, called the signature  or interface  of the operation, specifies the operation name and arguments (or parameters). The second part, called the method  or body,  specifies the implementation  of the operation, usually written in some general-purpose pro- gramming language. Operations can be invoked by passing a message  to an object, which includes the operation name and the parameters. The object then executes the method for that operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This encapsulation permits modification of the internal structure of an object, as well as the implementation of its operations, with-out the need to disturb the external programs that invoke these operations. Hence, encapsulation provides a form of data and operation independence (see Chapter 2). Another key concept in OO systems is that of type and class hierarchies and inheri- tance. This permits specification of new types or classes that inherit much of their structure and/or operations from previously defined types or classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "This makes it easier to develop the data types of a system incrementally and to reuse  existing type definitions when creating new types of objects. One problem in early OO database systems involved representing relationships among objects. The insistence on complete encapsulation in early OO data models led to the argument that relationships should not be explicitly represented, but should instead be described by defining appropriate methods that locate related objects. However, this approach does not work very well for complex databases with many relationships because it is useful to identify these relationships and make them visible to users.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ODMG object database standard has recognized this need and it explicitly represents binary relationships via a pair of inverse references , as we will describe in Section 12.3. Another OO concept is operator overloading,  which refers to an operation’s ability to be applied to different types of objects; in such a situation, an operation name may refer to several distinct implementations,  depending on the type of object it is applied to. This feature is also called operator polymorphism.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, an oper- ation to calculate the area of a geometric object may differ in its method (imple-mentation), depending on whether the object is of type triangle, circle, or rectangle. This may require the use of late binding  of the operation name to the appropriate method at runtime, when the type of object to which the operation is applied becomes known. 12.1 Overview of Object Database Concepts  367 In the next several sections, we discuss in some detail the main characteristics of object databases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 12.1.2 discusses object identity; Section 12.1.3 shows how the types for complex-structured objects are specified via type constructors; Section 12.1.4 discusses encapsulation and persistence; and Section 12.1.5 pres-ents inheritance concepts. Section 12.1.6 discusses some additional OO con-cepts, and Section 12.1.7 gives a summary of all the OO concepts that we introduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Section 12.2, we show how some of these concepts have been incorporated into the SQL:2008 standard for relational databases. Then in Sec-tion 12.3, we show how these concepts are realized in the ODMG 3.0 object data-base standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "12.1.2 Object Identity, and Objects versus Literals One goal of an ODB is to maintain a direct correspondence between real-world and database objects so that objects do not lose their integrity and identity and can easily be identified and operated upon. Hence, a unique identity  is assigned to each independent object stored in the database. This unique identity is typi-cally implemented via a unique, system-generated object identifier (OID) .\n",
      "\n",
      "The value of an OID may not be visible to the external user but is used internally by the system to identify each object uniquely and to create and manage interobject references. The OID can be assigned to program variables of the appropriate type when needed. The main property required of an OID is that it be immutable ; that is, the OID value of a particular object should not change. This preserves the identity of the real-world object being represented. Hence, an ODMS must have some mechanism for generating OIDs and preserving the immutability property.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also desirable that each OID be used only once; that is, even if an object is removed from the data-base, its OID should not be assigned to another object. These two properties imply that the OID should not depend on any attribute values of the object, since the value of an attribute may be changed or corrected. We can compare this with the relational model, where each relation must have a primary key attribute whose value identifies each tuple uniquely.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the value of the primary key is changed, the tuple will have a new identity, even though it may still represent the same real-world object. Alternatively, a real-world object may have different names for key attributes in different relations, making it difficult to ascertain that the keys repre-sent the same real-world object (for example, using the Emp_id  of an EMPLOYEE in one relation and the Ssn in another).\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also inappropriate to base the OID on the physical address of the object in stor- age, since the physical address can change after a physical reorganization of the database. However, some early ODMSs have used the physical address as the OID to increase the efficiency of object retrieval. If the physical address of the object changes, an indirect pointer  can be placed at the former address, which gives the new physical location of the object.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is more common to use long integers as OIDs and then to use some form of hash table to map the OID value to the current physi- cal address of the object in storage.368 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases Some early OO data models required that everything—from a simple value to a complex object—was represented as an object; hence, every basic value, such as an integer, string, or Boolean value, has an OID. This allows two identical basic values to have different OIDs, which can be useful in some cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the integer value 50 can sometimes be used to mean a weight in kilograms and at other times to mean the age of a person. Then, two basic objects with distinct OIDs could be cre-ated, but both objects would have the integer 50 as their value. Although useful as a theoretical model, this is not very practical, since it leads to the generation of too many OIDs. Hence, most ODBs allow for the representation of both objects and literals  (or values).\n",
      "\n",
      "Every object must have an immutable OID, whereas a literal value has no OID and its value just stands for itself. Thus, a literal value is typically stored within an object and cannot be referenced  from other objects. In many sys- tems, complex structured literal values can also be created without having a corre-sponding OID if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "12.1.3 Complex Type Structures for Objects and Literals Another feature of ODBs is that objects and literals may have a type structure  of arbitrary complexity  in order to contain all of the necessary information that describes the object or literal. In contrast, in traditional database systems, informa- tion about a complex object is often scattered  over many relations or records, lead- ing to loss of direct correspondence between a real-world object and its database representation. In ODBs, a complex type may be constructed from other types by nesting  of type constructors .\n",
      "\n",
      "The three most basic constructors are atom, struct (or tuple), and collection. 1. One type constructor has been called the atom  constructor, although this term is not used in the latest object standard. This includes the basic built-in data types of the object model, which are similar to the basic types in many programming languages: integers, strings, floating-point numbers, enumer-ated types, Booleans, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "These basic data types are called single- valued  or atomic  types, since each value of the type is considered an atomic (indivisible) single value. 2. A second type constructor is referred to as the struct  (or tuple ) constructor. This can create standard structured types, such as the tuples (record types) in the basic relational model. A structured type is made up of several com- ponents and is also sometimes referred to as a compound  or composite  type.\n",
      "\n",
      "More accurately, the struct constructor is not considered to be a type, but rather a type generator , because many different structured types can be cre- ated. For example, two different structured types that can be created are: struct Name<FirstName: string, MiddleInitial: char, LastName: string>, and struct CollegeDegree<Major: string, Degree: string, Year: date>. To create complex nested type structures in the object model, the collection  type con- structors are needed, which we discuss next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that the type construc-tors atom  and struct  are the only ones available in the original (basic) relational model. 12.1 Overview of Object Database Concepts  369 3. Collection  (or multivalued ) type constructors include the set(T) , list(T) , bag(T) , array(T) , and dictionary(K,T)  type constructors. These allow part of an object or literal value to include a collection of other objects or values when needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "These constructors are also considered to be type generators because many different types can be created. For example, set( string ), set(integer ), and set( Employee ) are three different types that can be created from the set type constructor. All the elements in a particular collection value must be of the same type. For example, all values in a collection of type set(string ) must be string values. The atom constructor  is used to represent all basic atomic values, such as integers, real numbers, character strings, Booleans, and any other basic data types that the system supports directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tuple constructor  can create structured values and objects of the form < a 1:i1, a2:i2, … , an:in>, where each aj is an attribute name6 and each ij is a value or an OID. The other commonly used constructors are collectively referred to as collection types but have individual differences among them. The set constructor  will create objects or literals that are a set of distinct  elements { i1, i2, … , in}, all of the same type.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bag constructor  (also called a multiset ) is similar to a set except that the elements in a bag need not be distinct . The list constructor  will create an ordered list [i1, i2, … , in] of OIDs or values of the same type. A list is similar to a bag except that the elements in a list are ordered,  and hence we can refer to the first, second, or jth element. The array constructor  creates a single-dimensional array of elements of the same type.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main difference between array and list is that a list can have an arbitrary number of elements whereas an array typically has a maximum size. Finally, the dictionary constructor  creates a collection of key-value pairs ( K, V), where the value of a key K can be used to retrieve the corresponding value V. The main characteristic of a collection type is that its objects or values will be a col- lection of objects or values of the same type  that may be unordered (such as a set or a bag) or ordered (such as a list or an array).\n",
      "\n",
      "The tuple  type constructor is often called a structured type , since it corresponds to the struct  construct in the C and C++ programming languages. An object definition language  (ODL ) 7 that incorporates the preceding type con- structors can be used to define the object types for a particular database application. In Section 12.3 we will describe the standard ODL of ODMG, but first we introduce the concepts gradually in this section using a simpler notation. The type construc-tors can be used to define the data structures  for an OO database schema.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fig- ure 12.1 shows how we may declare EMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT  types. In Figure 12.1, the attributes that refer to other objects—such as Dept  of EMPLOYEE or Projects  of DEPARTMENT —are basically OIDs that serve as references  to other objects to represent relationships  among the objects. For example, the attribute Dept 6Also called an instance variable name  in OO terminology.\n",
      "\n",
      "7This corresponds to the DDL (data definition language) of the database system (see Chapter 2).370 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases of EMPLOYEE  is of type DEPARTMENT  and hence is used to refer to a specific DEPARTMENT  object (the DEPARTMENT  object where the employee works). The value of such an attribute would be an OID for a specific DEPARTMENT  object. A binary relationship can be represented in one direction, or it can have an inverse reference.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latter representation makes it easy to traverse the relationship in both directions. For example, in Figure 12.1 the attribute Employees  of DEPARTMENT  has as its value a set of references  (that is, a set of OIDs) to objects of type EMPLOYEE ; these are the employees who work for the DEPARTMENT . The inverse is the refer- ence attribute Dept  of EMPLOYEE .\n",
      "\n",
      "We will see in Section 12.3 how the ODMG stan- dard allows inverses to be explicitly declared as relationship attributes to ensure that inverse references are consistent.\n",

      "12.1.4  Encapsulation of Operations and Persistence of Objects Encapsulation of Operations. The concept of encapsulation  is one of the main characteristics of OO languages and systems. It is also related to the concepts of abstract data types  and information hiding  in programming languages. In tradi- tional database models and systems this concept was not applied, since it is cus-tomary to make the structure of database objects visible to users and external programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In these traditional models, a number of generic database operations define type  EMPLOYEE tuple   ( Fname: string ; Minit : char; Lname: string ; Ssn: string ; Birth_date: DATE; Address: string ; Sex: char; Salary: float; Supervisor: EMPLOYEE; Dept: DEPARTMENT; define type  DATE tuple  ( Year: integer ; Month: integer ; Day: integer ; ); define type  DEPARTMENT tuple  ( Dname: string ; Dnumber: integer ; Mgr: tuple  ( Manager: EMPLOYEE; Start_date: DATE; ); Locations: set(string ); Employees: set(EMPLOYEE); Projects: set(PROJECT); );Figure 12.1 Specifying the object types EMPLOYEE, DATE, and  DEPARTMENT using type constructors.\n",
      "\n",
      "12.1 Overview of Object Database Concepts  371 are applicable to objects of all types . For example, in the relational model, the oper- ations for selecting, inserting, deleting, and modifying tuples are generic and may be applied to any relation  in the database. The relation and its attributes are visible to users and to external programs that access the relation by using these opera-tions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of encapsulation is applied to database objects in ODBs by defining the behavior  of a type of object based on the operations  that can be exter- nally applied to objects of that type. Some operations may be used to create (insert) or destroy (delete) objects; other operations may update the object state; and oth-ers may be used to retrieve parts of the object state or to apply some calculations. Still other operations may perform a combination of retrieval, calculation, and update.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, the implementation  of an operation can be specified in a general-purpose programming language  that provides flexibility and power in defining the operations. The external users of the object are only made aware of the interface  of the oper- ations, which defines the name and arguments (parameters) of each operation. The implementation is hidden from the external users; it includes the definition of any hidden internal data structures of the object and the implementation of the operations that access these structures. The interface part of an operation is sometimes called the signature , and the operation implementation is sometimes called the method .\n",
      "\n",
      "For database applications, the requirement that all objects be completely encapsu- lated is too stringent. One way to relax this requirement is to divide the structure of an object into visible  and hidden  attributes (instance variables). Visible attributes can be seen by and are directly accessible to the database users and programmers via the query language. The hidden attributes of an object are completely encapsu-lated and can be accessed only through predefined operations. Most ODMSs employ high-level query languages for accessing visible attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Section 12.5 we will describe the OQL query language that is proposed as a standard query lan-guage for ODBs. The term class  is often used to refer to a type definition, along with the definitions of the operations for that type. 8 Figure 12.2 shows how the type definitions in Fig- ure 12.1 can be extended with operations to define classes. A number of operations are declared for each class, and the signature (interface) of each operation is included in the class definition.\n",
      "\n",
      "A method (implementation) for each operation must be defined elsewhere using a programming language. Typical operations include the object constructor  operation (often called new), which is used to create a new object, and the destructor  operation, which is used to destroy (delete) an object. A number of object modifier  operations can also be declared to modify the states (values) of various attributes of an object. Additional operations can retrieve information about the object. 8This definition of class  is similar to how it is used in the popular C++ programming language.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ODMG standard uses the word interface  in addition to class  (see Section 12.3). In the EER model, the term class  was used to refer to an object type, along with the set of all objects of that type (see Chapter 8).372 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases An operation is typically applied to an object by using the dot notation .\n",
      "\n",
      "For exam- ple, if d is a reference to a DEPARTMENT  object, we can invoke an operation such as no_of_emps  by writing d.no_of_emps . Similarly, by writing d.destroy_dept , the object referenced by d is destroyed (deleted). The only exception is the constructor opera- tion, which returns a reference to a new DEPARTMENT  object.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, it is custom- ary in some OO models to have a default name for the constructor operation that is the name of the class itself, although this was not used in Figure 12.2.\n",

For example, for class EMPLOYEE, the default constructor name  is EMPLOYEE and the default destructor name  is ~EMPLOYEE.

An ODBS is often closely coupled with an object-oriented programming language (OOPL).\n",
      "\n",
      "The OOPL is used to specify the method (operation) implementations as well as other application code. Not all objects are meant to be stored permanently in the data-base. Transient objects  exist in the executing program and disappear once the pro- gram terminates. Persistent objects  are stored in the database and persist after program termination. The typical mechanisms for making an object persistent are naming  and reachability. The naming mechanism  involves giving an object a unique persistent name within a particular database.\n",
      "\n",
      "This persistent object name  can be given via a specific state- ment or operation in the program, as shown in Figure 12.3. The named persistent objects are used as entry points  to the database through which users and applica- tions can start their database access. Obviously, it is not practical to give names to all objects in a large database that includes thousands of objects, so most objects are made persistent by using the second mechanism, called reachability . The reach- ability mechanism works by making the object reachable from some other persis-tent object.\n",
      "\n",
      "An object B is said to be reachable  from an object A if a sequence of references in the database lead from object A to object B. If we first create a named persistent object N, whose state is a set of objects of some class C, we can make objects of C persistent by adding them  to the set, thus making them reachable from N. Hence, N is a named object that defines a persistent collection  of objects of class C. In the object model standard, N is called the extent of C (see Section 12.3).\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we can define a class DEPARTMENT_SET  (see Figure 12.3) whose objects are of type set(DEPARTMENT ).10 We can create an object of type DEPARTMENT_SET , and give it a persistent name ALL_DEPARTMENTS , as shown in Figure 12.3. Any DEPARTMENT  object that is added to the set of ALL_DEPARTMENTS by using the add_dept  operation becomes persistent by virtue of its being reach- able from ALL_DEPARTMENTS .\n",
      "\n",
      "As we will see in Section 12.3, the ODMG ODL standard gives the schema designer the option of naming an extent as part of class definition. Notice the difference between traditional database models and ODBs in this respect. In traditional database models, such as the relational model, all objects are assumed to be persistent. Hence, when a table such as EMPLOYEE  is created in a relational database, it represents both the type declaration  for EMPLOYEE  and a persistent set of all EMPLOYEE  records (tuples).\n",

      "In the OO approach, a class declaration of EMPLOYEE  specifies only the type and operations for a class of objects.\n",

We use a simple OO model in this section—a model in which attributes and operations are treated uniformly—since both attributes and operations can be inherited.

A function name can be used to refer to the value of an attribute or to refer to the resulting value of an operation (method).\n",

      "As another example, consider a type that describes objects in plane geometry, which may be defined as follows: GEOMETRY_OBJECT: Shape, Area, Reference_point For the GEOMETRY_OBJECT  type, Shape  is implemented as an attribute (its domain can be an enumerated type with values ‘triangle’, ‘rectangle’, ‘circle’, and so on), and 376 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases Area  is a method that is applied to calculate the area.\n",

      "In the ODMG model (see Section 12.3), the user may or may not specify an extent for each class (type), depending on the application. An extent is a named persistent object whose value is a persistent collection  that holds a collection of objects of the same type that are stored permanently in the database. The objects can be accessed and shared by multiple programs. It is also possible to create a transient collection , which exists temporarily during the execu- tion of a program but is not kept when the program terminates.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, a transient collection may be created in a program to hold the result of a query that selects some objects from a persistent collection and copies those objects into the transient collection. The program can then manipulate the objects in the transient collection, and once the program terminates, the transient collection ceases to exist. In general, numerous collections—transient or persistent—may contain objects of the same type. 14This is called OBJECT in the ODMG model (see Section 12.3).\n",
      "\n",
      "12.1 Overview of Object Database Concepts  377 The inheritance model discussed in this section is very simple. As we will see in Sec- tion 12.3, the ODMG model distinguishes between type inheritance—called inter- face inheritance  and denoted by a colon (:)—and the extent inheritance constraint—denoted by the keyword EXTEND .\n",

      "12.1.6 Other Object-Oriented Concepts Polymorphism of Operations (Operator Overloading). Another characteris- tic of OO systems in general is that they provide for polymorphism  of operations, which is also known as operator overloading . This concept allows the same opera- tor name  or symbol  to be bound to two or more different implementations  of the operator, depending on the type of objects to which the operator is applied. A sim-ple example from programming languages can illustrate this concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some lan-guages, the operator symbol “+” can mean different things when applied to operands (objects) of different types. If the operands of “+” are of type integer , the operation invoked is integer addition. If the operands of “+” are of type floating point , the operation invoked is floating-point addition. If the operands of “+” are of type set, the operation invoked is set union. The compiler can determine which operation to execute based on the types of operands supplied. In OO databases, a similar situation may occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can use the GEOMETRY_OBJECT example presented in Section 12.1.5 to illustrate operation polymorphism15 in ODB. In this example, the function Area  is declared for all objects of type GEOMETRY_OBJECT . However, the implementation of the method for Area  may differ for each subtype of GEOMETRY_OBJECT .\n",
      "\n",
      "One possibility is to have a general implementation for calculating the area of a generalized GEOMETRY_OBJECT  (for example, by writing a general algorithm to calculate the area of a polygon) and then to rewrite more efficient algorithms to calculate the areas of specific types of geo-metric objects, such as a circle, a rectangle, a triangle, and so on. In this case, the Area function is overloaded  by different implementations. The ODMS must now select the appropriate method for the Area function based on the type of geometric object to which it is applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "In strongly typed systems, this can be done at compile time, since the object types must be known. This is termed early  (or static ) binding . However, in systems with weak typing or no typing (such as Smalltalk, LISP, PHP, and most scripting languages), the type of the object to which a function is applied may not be known until runtime. In this case, the func-tion must check the type of object at runtime and then invoke the appropriate method. This is often referred to as late (or dynamic ) binding .\n",
      "\n",
      "Multiple Inheritance and Selective Inheritance. Multiple inheritance  occurs when a certain subtype T is a subtype of two (or more) types and hence inherits the functions (attributes and methods) of both supertypes. For example, we may create 15In programming languages, there are several kinds of polymorphism.\n",

This leads to the creation of a type lattice  rather than a type hierarchy. One problem that can occur with multiple inheritance is that the supertypes from which the subtype inherits may have distinct functions of the same name, creating an ambiguity.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, both MANAGER  and ENGINEER  may have a function called Salary . If the Salary  function is implemented by different methods in the MANAGER and ENGINEER  supertypes, an ambiguity exists as to which of the two is inherited by the subtype ENGINEERING_MANAGER . It is possible, however, that both ENGINEER and MANAGER  inherit Salary  from the same supertype (such as EMPLOYEE ) higher up in the lattice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The general rule is that if a function is inherited from some com- mon supertype,  then it is inherited only once. In such a case, there is no ambiguity; the problem only arises if the functions are distinct in the two supertypes. There are several techniques for dealing with ambiguity in multiple inheritance. One solution is to have the system check for ambiguity when the subtype is created, and to let the user explicitly choose which function is to be inherited at this time. A second solution is to use some system default.\n",
      "\n",
      "A third solution is to disallow mul-tiple inheritance altogether if name ambiguity occurs, instead forcing the user to change the name of one of the functions in one of the supertypes. Indeed, some OO systems do not permit multiple inheritance at all. In the object database standard (see Section 12.3), multiple inheritance is allowed for operation inheritance of interfaces, but is not allowed for EXTENDS  inheritance of classes. Selective inheritance  occurs when a subtype inherits only some of the functions of a supertype. Other functions are not inherited.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, an EXCEPT  clause may be used to list the functions in a supertype that are not to be inherited by the sub- type. The mechanism of selective inheritance is not typically provided in ODBs, but it is used more frequently in artificial intelligence applications.16\n",
      "\n",
      "12.1.7 Summary of Object Database Concepts To conclude this section, we give a summary of the main concepts used in ODBs and object-relational systems: ■Object identity. Objects have unique identities that are independent of their attribute values and are generated by the ODB system. ■Type constructors. Complex object structures can be constructed by apply- ing in a nested manner a set of basic type generators/constructors, such as tuple, set, list, array, and bag. ■Encapsulation of operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the object structure and the operations that can be applied to individual objects are included in the class/type definitions. ■Programming language compatibility. Both persistent and transient objects are handled seamlessly. Objects are made persistent by being reachable from 16In the ODMG model, type inheritance refers to inheritance of operations only, not attributes (see Section 12.3).\n",

Object types can be specified by using a type hierarchy, which allows the inheritance of both attributes and methods (operations) of previously defined types. Multiple inheritance is allowed in some models. ■Extents.\n",
      "\n",
      "All persistent objects of a particular class/type C can be stored in an extent, which is a named persistent object of type set(C). Extents corre-sponding to a type hierarchy have set/subset constraints enforced on their collections of persistent objects. ■Polymorphism and operator overloading. Operations and method names can be overloaded to apply to different object types with different imple-mentations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the following sections we show how these concepts are realized, first in the SQL standard (Section 12.2) and then in the ODMG standard (Section 12.3).\n",
      "\n",
      "12.2 Object Database Extensions to SQL   We introduced SQL as the standard language for RDBMSs in Chapters 6 and 7. As we discussed, SQL was first specified by Chamberlin and Boyce (1974) and under-went enhancements and standardization in 1989 and 1992. The language continued its evolution with a new standard, initially called SQL3 while being developed and later known as SQL:99 for the parts of SQL3 that were approved into the standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the version of SQL known as SQL3, features from object databases were incorporated into the SQL standard. At first, these extensions were known as SQL/Object, but later they were incorporated in the main part of SQL, known as SQL/Foundation in SQL:2008. The relational model with object database enhancements is sometimes referred to as the object-relational model . Additional revisions were made to SQL in 2003 and 2006 to add features related to XML (see Chapter 13).\n",
      "\n",
      "The following are some of the object database features that have been included in SQL: ■Some type constructors  have been added to specify complex objects. These include the row type , which corresponds to the tuple (or struct) constructor. An array type  for specifying collections is also provided. Other collection type constructors, such as set, list, and bag constructors, were not part of the original SQL/Object specifications in SQL:99 but were later included in the standard in SQL:2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "■A mechanism for specifying object identity  through the use of reference type is included. ■Encapsulation of operations  is provided through the mechanism of user-defined types (UDTs) that may include operations as part of their declaration. These are somewhat similar to the concept of abstract data 380 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases types  that were developed in programming languages. In addition, the concept of user-defined routines (UDRs) allows the definition of general methods (operations).\n",
      "\n",
      "■Inheritance  mechanisms are provided using the keyword UNDER . We now discuss each of these concepts in more detail. In our discussion, we will refer to the example in Figure 12.4.\n",
      "\n",
      "12.2.1  User-Defined Types Using CREATE TYPE and Complex Objects To allow the creation of complex-structured objects and to separate the declaration of a class/type from the creation of a table (which is the collection of objects/rows and hence corresponds to the extent discussed in Section 12.1), SQL now provides user-defined types  (UDT s). In addition, four collection types have been included to allow for collections (multivalued types and attributes) in order to specify com-plex-structured objects rather than just simple (flat) records.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user will create the UDTs for a particular application as part of the database schema. A UDT  may be specified in its simplest form using the following syntax: CREATE TYPE  TYPE_NAME AS (<component declarations>); Figure 12.4 illustrates some of the object concepts in SQL. We will explain the examples in this figure gradually as we explain the concepts. First, a UDT can be used as either the type for an attribute or as the type for a table.\n",
      "\n",
      "By using a UDT as the type for an attribute within another UDT, a complex structure for objects (tuples) in a table can be created, much like that achieved by nesting type construc-tors/generators as discussed in Section 12.1. This is similar to using the struct type constructor of Section 12.1.3.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in Figure 12.4(a), the UDT STREET_ADDR_TYPE  is used as the type for the STREET_ADDR  attribute in the UDT USA_ADDR_TYPE . Similarly, the UDT USA_ADDR_TYPE  is in turn used as the type for the ADDR  attribute in the UDT PERSON_TYPE  in Figure 12.4(b).\n",
      "\n",
      "If a UDT does not have any operations, as in the examples in Figure 12.4(a), it is possible to use  the concept of ROW TYPE  to directly create a structured attribute by using the keyword ROW .\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we could use the following instead of declaring STREET_ADDR_TYPE  as a separate type as in Figure 12.4(a): CREATE TYPE  USA_ADDR_TYPE AS ( STREET_ADDR ROW  ( NUMBER VARCHAR (5), STREET_NAME VARCHAR (25), APT_NO VARCHAR (5), SUITE_NO VARCHAR (5) ), CITY VARCHAR (25), ZIP VARCHAR (10) ); To allow for collection types in order to create complex-structured objects, four constructors are now included in SQL: ARRAY , MULTISET , LIST, and SET.\n",

For example, PHONES[1]  refers to the first location value in a PHONES  attribute (see Figure 12.4(b)). A built-in function CARDINALITY  can return the current number of elements in an array (or any other collection type).

      "\n",
      "12.2.2 Object Identifiers Using Reference Types Unique system-generated object identifiers can be created via the reference type using the keyword REF. For example, in Figure 12.4(b), the phrase: REF IS SYSTEM GENERATED indicates that whenever a new PERSON_TYPE  object is created, the system will assign it a unique system-generated identifier. It is also possible not to have a system-generated object identifier and use the traditional keys of the basic relational model if desired.\n",

The options for < VALUE_GENERATION_ METHOD > are SYSTEM GENERATED  or DERIVED .\n",

      "In the former case, the system will automatically generate a unique identifier for each tuple. In the latter case, the traditional method of using the user-provided primary key value to identify tuples is applied.\n",

      "12.2.3 Creating Tables Based on the UDTs For each UDT that is specified to be instantiable via the phrase INSTANTIABLE  (see Figure 12.4(b)), one or more tables may be created. This is illustrated in Fig- ure 12.4(d), where we create a table PERSON  based on the PERSON_TYPE  UDT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that the UDTs in Figure 12.4(a) are noninstantiable  and hence can only be used as 384 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases types for attributes, but not as a basis for table creation. In Figure 12.4(b), the attri- bute PERSON_ID  will hold the system-generated object identifier whenever a new PERSON  record (object) is created and inserted in the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "12.2.4 Encapsulation of Operations In SQL, a user-defined type  can have its own behavioral specification by specifying methods (or operations) in addition to the attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The general form of a UDT specification with methods is as follows: CREATE TYPE  <TYPE-NAME> ( <LIST OF COMPONENT ATTRIBUTES AND THEIR TYPES> <DECLARATION OF FUNCTIONS (METHODS)> ); For example, in Figure 12.4(b), we declared a method Age()  that calculates the age of an individual object of type PERSON_TYPE . The code for implementing the method still has to be written.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can refer to the method implementation by specifying the file that contains the code for the method, or we can write the actual code within the type declaration itself (see Figure 12.4(b)). SQL provides certain built-in functions for user-defined types. For a UDT called TYPE_T , the constructor function  TYPE_T ( ) returns a new object of that type. In the new UDT object, every attribute is initialized to its default value. An observer function  A is implicitly created for each attribute A to read its value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, A(X) or X.A returns the value of attribute A of TYPE_T  if X is a variable that refers to an object/row of type TYPE_T . A mutator function  for updating an attribute sets the value of the attribute to a new value. SQL allows these functions to be blocked from public use; an EXECUTE  privilege is needed to have access to these functions. In general, a UDT can have a number of user-defined functions associated with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The syntax is INSTANCE METHOD  <NAME> (<ARGUMENT_LIST>) RETURNS <RETURN_TYPE>; Two types of functions can be defined: internal SQL and external. Internal functions are written in the extended PSM language of SQL (see Chapter 10). External func-tions are written in a host language, with only their signature (interface) appearing in the UDT definition.\n",
      "\n",
      "An external function definition can be declared as follows: DECLARE EXTERNAL  <FUNCTION_NAME> <SIGNATURE> LANGUAGE  <LANGUAGE_NAME>; Attributes and functions in UDTs are divided into three categories: ■PUBLIC (visible at the UDT interface) ■PRIVATE (not visible at the UDT interface) ■PROTECTED (visible only to subtypes) 12.2 Object Database Extensions to SQL  385 It is also possible to define virtual attributes as part of UDTs, which are computed and updated using functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "12.2.5 Specifying Inheritance and Overloading of Functions In SQL, inheritance can be applied to types or to tables; we will discuss the meaning of each in this section. Recall that we already discussed many of the principles of inheritance in Section 12.1.5. SQL has rules for dealing with type inheritance (specified via the UNDER  keyword). In general, both attributes and instance meth- ods (operations) are inherited.\n",
      "\n",
      "The phrase NOT FINAL  must be included in a UDT if subtypes are allowed to be created under that UDT (see Figures 12.4(a) and (b), where PERSON_TYPE , STUDENT_TYPE , and EMPLOYEE_TYPE  are declared to be NOT FINAL ). Associated with type inheritance are the rules for overloading of func- tion implementations and for resolution of function names. These inheritance rules can be summarized as follows: ■All attributes are inherited.\n",
      "\n",
      "■The order of supertypes in the UNDER  clause determines the inheritance hierarchy. ■An instance of a subtype can be used in every context in which a supertype instance is used. ■A subtype can redefine any function that is defined in its supertype, with the restriction that the signature be the same. ■When a function is called, the best match is selected based on the types of all arguments. ■For dynamic linking, the types of the parameters are considered at runtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider the following examples to illustrate type inheritance, which are illustrated in Figure 12.4(c). Suppose that we want to create two subtypes of PERSON_TYPE : EMPLOYEE_TYPE  and STUDENT_TYPE . In addition, we also create a subtype MANAGER_TYPE  that inherits all the attributes (and methods) of EMPLOYEE_TYPE but has an additional attribute DEPT_MANAGED . These subtypes are shown in Figure 12.4(c).\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, we specify the local (specific) attributes and any additional specific methods for the subtype, which inherits the attributes and operations (methods) of its supertype. Another facility in SQL is table inheritance  via the supertable/subtable facility. This is also specified using the keyword UNDER  (see Figure 12.4(d)). Here, a new record that is inserted into a subtable, say the MANAGER  table, is also inserted into its supertables EMPLOYEE  and PERSON .\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that when a record is inserted in MANAGER , we must provide values for all its inherited attributes. INSERT , DELETE , and UPDATE  operations are appropriately propagated. Basically, table inheritance corresponds to the extent inheritance  discussed in Section 12.1.5. The rule is that a tuple in a sub-table must also exist in its super-table to enforce the set/subset con-straint on the objects.386 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases\n",

      "12.2.6 Specifying Relationships via Reference A component attribute of one tuple may be a reference  (specified using the key- word REF) to a tuple of another (or possibly the same) table. An example is shown in Figure 12.4(e). The keyword SCOPE  specifies the name of the table whose tuples can be referenced by the reference attribute. Notice that this is similar to a foreign key, except that the system-generated OID value is used rather than the primary key value.\n",
      "\n",
      "SQL uses a dot notation  to build path expressions  that refer to the component attributes of tuples and row types. However, for an attribute whose type is REF, the dereferencing symbol –> is used.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the query below retrieves employees working in the company named ‘ABCXYZ’ by querying the EMPLOYMENT  table: SELECT  E.Employee–>NAME FROM  EMPLOYMENT AS E WHERE  E.Company–>COMP_NAME = ‘ABCXYZ’; In SQL, –> is used for dereferencing  and has the same meaning assigned to it in the C programming language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, if r is a reference to a tuple (object) and a is a com- ponent attribute in that tuple, then r –> a is the value of attribute a in that tuple.

      " As we discussed in the introduction to Chapter 6, one of the reasons for the success of commercial relational DBMSs is the SQL standard. The lack of a standard for ODBs for several years may have caused some potential users to shy away from con-verting to this new technology.

It is meant to provide a standard data model for object databases, just as SQL describes a standard data model for relational databases. It also provides a standard terminology in a field where the same terms were sometimes used to describe different concepts. We will try to adhere to the ODMG terminology in this chapter.\n",

      "Many of the concepts in the ODMG model have already been discussed in Section 12.1, and we assume the reader has read this section. We will point out whenever the ODMG terminology differs from that used in Section 12.1. Objects and Literals. Objects and literals are the basic building blocks of the object model. The main difference between the two is that an object has both an object identifier and a state  (or current value), whereas a literal has a value (state) but no object identifier.\n",
      "\n",
      "18 In either case, the value can have a complex structure. The object state can change over time by modifying the object value. A literal is basically a constant value, possibly having a complex structure, but it does not change. An object  has five aspects: identifier, name, lifetime, structure, and creation. 1. The object identifier  is a unique system-wide identifier (or Object_id ).19 Every object must have an object identifier. 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some objects may optionally be given a unique name  within a particular ODMS—this name can be used to locate the object, and the system should return the object given that name. 20 Obviously, not all individual objects will have unique names. Typically, a few objects, mainly those that hold collections of objects of a particular object class/type—such as extents —will have a name. These names are used as entry points  to the database; that is, by locating these objects by their unique name, the user can then locate other objects that are referenced from these objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other important objects in the application may also have unique names, and it is possible to give more than one  name to an object. All names within a particular ODB must be unique. 18We will use the terms value  and state interchangeably here. 19This corresponds to the OID of Section 12.1.2. 20This corresponds to the naming mechanism for persistence, described in Section 12.1.4.388 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases 3.\n",

Hence, database and application objects are typically created based on the user-specified class declarations that form a database schema.

A class may also inherit behavior from several inter-faces via colon (:) notation, in addition to inheriting behavior and state from at most one  other class via extends .\n",

The locations attribute of DEPARTMENT  is defined via the set constructor, since each DEPARTMENT  object can have a set of locations.\n",

In the object model of ODMG, only binary relationships (see Section 3.4) are explicitly represented, and each binary relationship is represented by a pair of inverse references  specified via the keyword relationship.

If two classes A and B have extent s ALL_A  and ALL_B , and class B is a subtype of class A (that is, class B extends  class A), then the collection of objects in ALL_B  must be a subset of those in ALL_A  at any point.

      "12.4 Object Database Conceptual Design   Section 12.4.1 discusses how object database (ODB) design differs from relational database (RDB) design. Section 12.4.2 outlines a mapping algorithm that can be used to create an ODB schema, made of ODMG ODL class definitions, from a con-ceptual EER schema.\n",
      "\n",
      "12.4.1 Differences between Conceptual Design of ODB and RDB One of the main differences between ODB and RDB design is how relationships are handled. In ODB, relationships are typically handled by having relationship prop- erties or reference attributes that include OID(s) of the related objects. These can be considered as OID references  to the related objects. Both single references and col- lections of references are allowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "References for a binary relationship can be 33This is similar to how an M:N relationship is mapped in the relational model (see Section 9.1) and in the legacy network model (see Appendix E).406 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases declared in a single direction, or in both directions, depending on the types of access expected. If declared in both directions, they may be specified as inverses of one another, thus enforcing the ODB equivalent of the relational referential integ-rity constraint.\n",
      "\n",
      "In RDB, relationships among tuples (records) are specified by attributes with matching values. These can be considered as value references  and are specified via foreign keys,  which are values of primary key attributes repeated in tuples of the referencing relation. These are limited to being single-valued in each record because multivalued attributes are not permitted in the basic relational model. Thus, M:N relationships must be represented not directly, but as a separate relation (table), as discussed in Section 9.1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mapping binary relationships that contain attributes is not straightforward in ODBs, since the designer must choose in which direction the attributes should be included. If the attributes are included in both directions, then redundancy in stor-age will exist and may lead to inconsistent data. Hence, it is sometimes preferable to use the relational approach of creating a separate table by creating a separate class to represent the relationship. This approach can also be used for n-ary relation- ships, with degree n > 2. Another major area of difference between ODB and RDB design is how inheritance is handled.\n",
      "\n",
      "In ODB, these structures are built into the model, so the mapping is achieved by using the inheritance constructs, such as derived  (:) and extends . In relational design, as we discussed in Section 9.2, there are several options to choose from since no built-in construct exists for inheritance in the basic relational model. It is important to note, though, that object-relational and extended-relational sys- tems are adding features to model these constructs directly as well as to include operation specifications in abstract data types (see Section 12.2).\n",
      "\n",
      "The third major difference is that in ODB design, it is necessary to specify the oper- ations early on in the design since they are part of the class specifications. Although it is important to specify operations during the design phase for all types of data-bases, the design of operations may be delayed in RDB design as it is not strictly required until the implementation phase. There is a philosophical difference between the relational model and the object model of data in terms of behavioral specification.\n",
      "\n",
      "The relational model does not mandate the database designers to predefine a set of valid behaviors or operations, whereas this is a tacit requirement in the object model. One of the claimed advan-tages of the relational model is the support of ad hoc queries and transactions, whereas these are against the principle of encapsulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, it is becoming commonplace to have database design teams apply object-based methodologies at early stages of conceptual design so that both the structure and the use or operations of the data are considered, and a complete spec-ification is developed during conceptual design. These specifications are then mapped into relational schemas, constraints, and behavioral artifacts such as trig-gers or stored procedures (see Sections 5.2 and 13.4). 12.4 Object Database Conceptual Design  407\n",
      "\n",
      "12.4.2 Mapping an EER Schema to an ODB Schema It is relatively straightforward to design the type declarations of object classes for an ODBMS from an EER schema that contains neither  categories nor n -ary relationships with n > 2. However, the operations of classes are not specified in the EER diagram and must be added to the class declarations after the struc-tural mapping is completed. The outline of the mapping from EER to ODL is as follows: Step 1. Create an ODL class  for each EER entity type or subclass.\n",
      "\n",
      "The type of the ODL class should include all the attributes of the EER class. 34 Multivalued attributes are typically declared by using the set, bag, or list constructors.35 If the values of the multivalued attribute for an object should be ordered, the list constructor is chosen; if duplicates are allowed, the bag constructor should be chosen; otherwise, the set constructor is chosen. Composite attributes  are mapped into a tuple constructor (by using a struct declaration in ODL).\n",
      "\n",
      "Declare an extent for each class, and specify any key attributes as keys of the extent.Step 2. Add relationship properties or reference attributes for each binary relation- ship into the ODL classes that participate in the relationship. These may be created in one or both directions. If a binary relationship is represented by references in both directions, declare the references to be relationship properties that are inverses of one another, if such a facility exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "36 If a binary relationship is represented by a reference in only one direction, declare the reference to be an attribute in the refer- encing class whose type is the referenced class name. Depending on the cardinality ratio of the binary relationship, the relationship properties or reference attributes may be single-valued or collection types. They will be single-valued  for binary relationships in the 1:1 or N:1 directions; they will be collection types  (set-valued or list-valued 37) for relationships in the 1:N or M:N direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "An alternative way to map binary M:N relationships is discussed in step 7. If relationship attributes exist, a tuple constructor ( struct ) can be used to create a structure of the form < reference , relationship attributes >, which may be included instead of the reference attribute. However, this does not allow the use of the inverse constraint . Additionally, if this choice is represented in both directions,  the attribute values will be represented twice, creating redundancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "34This implicitly uses a tuple constructor at the top level of the type declaration, but in general, the tuple constructor is not explicitly shown in the ODL class declarations. 35Further analysis of the application domain is needed to decide which constructor to use because this information is not available from the EER schema. 36The ODL standard provides for the explicit definition of inverse relationships. Some ODBMS products may not provide this support; in such cases, programmers must maintain every relationship explicitly by coding the methods that update the objects appropriately.\n",
      "\n",
      "37The decision whether to use set or list is not available from the EER schema and must be determined from the requirements.408 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases Step 3. Include appropriate operations for each class. These are not available from the EER schema and must be added to the database design by referring to the origi-nal requirements. A constructor method should include program code that checks any constraints that must hold when a new object is created. A destructor method should check any constraints that may be violated when an object is deleted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other methods should include any further constraint checks that are relevant. Step 4. An ODL class that corresponds to a subclass in the EER schema inherits (via extends ) the attributes, relationships, and methods of its superclass in the ODL schema. Its specific  (local) attributes, relationship references, and operations are specified, as discussed in steps 1, 2, and 3. Step 5. Weak entity types can be mapped in the same way as regular entity types.\n",
      "\n",
      "An alternative mapping is possible for weak entity types that do not participate in any relationships except their identifying relationship; these can be mapped as though they were composite multivalued attributes  of the owner entity type, by using the set<struct <…>> or list<struct <…>> constructors. The attributes of the weak entity are included in the struct <…> construct, which corresponds to a tuple constructor. Attributes are mapped as discussed in steps 1 and 2. Step 6. Categories (union types) in an EER schema are difficult to map to ODL.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is possible to create a mapping similar to the EER-to-relational mapping (see Sec- tion 9.2) by declaring a class to represent the category and defining 1:1 relationships between the category and each of its superclasses. Step 7. An n-ary relationship with degree n > 2 can be mapped into a separate class, with appropriate references to each participating class. These references are based on mapping a 1:N relationship from each class that represents a participating entity type to the class that represents the n-ary relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "An M:N binary relationship, especially if it contains relationship attributes, may also use this mapping option, if desired.

      "12.5.1  Simple OQL Queries, Database Entry Points, and Iterator Variables The basic OQL syntax is a select … from … where …  structure, as it is for SQL. For example, the query to retrieve the names of all departments in the college of  ‘Engineering’ can be written as follows: Q0: select D.Dname from  D in DEPARTMENTS where  D.College  = ‘Engineering’; In general, an entry point  to the database is needed for each query, which can be any named persistent object.\n",
      "\n",
      "For many queries, the entry point is the name of the extent  of a class. Recall that the extent name is considered to be the name of a persis- tent object whose type is a collection (in most cases, a set) of objects from the class. Looking at the extent names in Figure 12.10, the named object DEPARTMENTS  is of type set<DEPARTMENT >; PERSONS  is of type set<PERSON >; FACULTY  is of type set<FACULTY >; and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of an extent name— DEPARTMENTS  in Q0—as an entry point refers to a persistent collection of objects. Whenever a collection is referenced in an OQL query, we should define an iterator variable 38—D in Q0—that ranges over each object in the collection. In many cases, as in Q0, the query will select certain objects from the collection, based on the conditions specified in the where  clause.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Q0, only persistent objects D in the collection of DEPARTMENTS  that satisfy the condi- tion D.College  = ‘Engineering’ are selected for the query result. For each selected object D, the value of D.Dname  is retrieved in the query result. Hence, the type of the result  for Q0 is bag<string > because the type of each Dname  value is string  (even though the actual result is a set because Dname  is a key attribute).\n",

      "In general, the result of a query would be of type bag for select … from …  and of type set for select distinct … from …  , as in SQL (adding the keyword distinct  eliminates duplicates).\n",

      "Using the example in Q0, there are three syntactic options for specifying iterator variables: D in DEPARTMENTS DEPARTMENTS  D DEPARTMENTS AS D 38This is similar to the tuple variables that range over tuples in SQL queries.410 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases We will use the first construct in our examples.39 The named objects used as database entry points for OQL queries are not limited to the names of extents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any named persistent object, whether it refers to an atomic (single) object or to a collection object, can be used as a database entry point.\n",
      "\n",
      "12.5.2 Query Results and Path Expressions In general, the result of a query can be of any type that can be expressed in the ODMG object model. A query does not have to follow the select … from … where … structure; in the simplest case, any persistent name on its own is a query, whose result is a reference to that persistent object. For example, the query Q1: DEPARTMENTS; returns a reference to the collection of all persistent DEPARTMENT  objects, whose type is set<DEPARTMENT >.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, suppose we had given (via the database bind operation, see Figure 12.8) a persistent name CS_DEPARTMENT  to a single DEPARTMENT  object (the Computer Science department); then, the query Q1A:  CS_DEPARTMENT; returns a reference to that individual object of type DEPARTMENT . Once an entry point is specified, the concept of a path expression  can be used to specify a path  to related attributes and objects. A path expression typically starts at a persistent object name,  or at the iterator variable that ranges over individual objects in a collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "This name will be followed by zero or more relationship names or attribute names connected using the dot notation.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, referring to the UNIVERSITY  database in Figure 12.10, the following are examples of path expressions, which are also valid queries in OQL: Q2: CS_DEPARTMENT.Chair; Q2A:  CS_DEPARTMENT.Chair.Rank; Q2B: CS_DEPARTMENT.Has_faculty; The first expression Q2 returns an object of type FACULTY , because that is the type of the attribute Chair  of the DEPARTMENT  class.\n",

      "\n",
      "The second expression Q2A  is similar, except that it returns the Rank  of this FACULTY  object (the Computer Science chair) rather than the object reference; hence, the type returned by Q2A  is string , which is the data type for the Rank  attribute of the FACULTY  class. Path expressions Q2 and Q2A  return single values, because the attributes Chair  (of DEPARTMENT ) and Rank  (of FACULTY ) are both single-valued and they are applied to a single object.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third expression, Q2B , is different; it returns an object of type set<FACULTY > even when applied to a single object, because that is the type of the relationship Has_faculty  of the DEPARTMENT  class. The collection returned will include 39Note that the latter two options are similar to the syntax for specifying tuple variables in SQL queries.\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, to return the ranks of Computer Science faculty, we cannot  write Q3′: CS_DEPARTMENT.Has_faculty.Rank; because it is not clear whether the object returned would be of type set<string > or bag<string > (the latter being more likely, since multiple faculty may share the same rank). Because of this type of ambiguity problem, OQL does not allow expressions such as Q3′.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather, one must use an iterator variable over any collections, as in Q3A  or Q3B  below: Q3A:  select  F.Rank from  F in CS_DEPARTMENT.Has_faculty; Q3B:  select  distinct  F.Rank from  F in CS_DEPARTMENT.Has_faculty; Here, Q3A  returns bag<string > (duplicate rank values appear in the result), whereas Q3B  returns set<string > (duplicates are eliminated via the distinct  keyword).\n",

The variable F in Q3A  and Q3B  ranges over the elements of the collection CS_DEPARTMENT.Has_faculty , which is of type set<FACULTY >, and includes only those faculty who are members of the Computer Science department. In general, an OQL query can return a result with a complex structure specified in the query itself by utilizing the struct  keyword.\n",

      "For example, one can write the following queries to retrieve the grade point average of all senior students majoring in Computer Science, with the result ordered by GPA, and within that by last and first name: Q5A:  select struct  (  last_name:  S.name.Lname, first_name:  S.name.Fname, gpa: S.gpa ) from  S in CS_DEPARTMENT.Has_majors where  S.Class  = ‘senior’ order by  gpa desc , last_name asc, first_name asc; Q5B:  select struct  (  last_name:  S.name.Lname, first_name:  S.name.Fname, gpa: S.gpa ) from   S in STUDENTS where  S.Majors_in.Dname  = ‘Computer Science’ and S.Class  = ‘senior’ order by  gpa desc , last_name asc, first_name asc; Q5A  used the named entry point CS_DEPARTMENT  to directly locate the reference to the Computer Science department and then locate the students via the relation- ship Has_majors , whereas Q5B  searches the STUDENTS  extent to locate all students majoring in that department.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice how attribute names, relationship names, and operation (method) names are all used interchangeably (in an orthogonal manner) in the path expressions: gpa is an operation; Majors_in  and Has_majors  are relation- ships; and Class , Name , Dname , Lname , and Fname  are attributes. The implementa- tion of the gpa operation computes the grade point average and returns its value as a float type for each selected STUDENT .\n",
      "\n",
      "The order by  clause is similar to the corresponding SQL construct, and specifies in which order the query result is to be displayed. Hence, the collection returned by a query with an order by  clause is of type list.\n",
      "\n",
      "12.5.3 Other Features of OQL Specifying Views as Named Queries. The view mechanism in OQL uses the concept of a named query . The define  keyword is used to specify an identifier of the named query, which must be a unique name among all named objects, class names, method names, and function names in the schema. If the identifier has the same name as an existing named query, then the new definition replaces the previous definition. Once defined, a query definition is persistent until it is redefined or deleted.\n",
      "\n",
      "A view can also have parameters (arguments) in its definition.\n",
      "\n",
      "12.5 The Object Query Language OQL  413 For example, the following view V1 defines a named query Has_minors  to retrieve the set of objects for students minoring in a given department: V1: define  Has_minors(Dept_name) as select  S from  S in STUDENTS where  S.Minors_in.Dname  = Dept_name; Because the ODL schema in Figure 12.10 only provided a unidirectional Minors_in attribute for a STUDENT , we can use the above view to represent its inverse without having to explicitly define a relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "This type of view can be used to represent inverse relationships that are not expected to be used frequently. The user can now utilize the above view to write queries such as Has_minors (‘Computer Science’); which would return a bag of students minoring in the Computer Science depart- ment. Note that in Figure 12.10, we defined Has_majors  as an explicit relationship, presumably because it is expected to be used more often. Extracting Single Elements from Singleton Collections.\n",
      "\n",
      "An OQL query will, in general, return a collection  as its result, such as a bag, set (if distinct  is specified), or list (if the order by  clause is used). If the user requires that a query only return a sin- gle element, there is an element  operator in OQL that is guaranteed to return a single element E from a singleton collection C that contains only one element. If C contains more than one element or if C is empty, then the element operator raises an exception.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, Q6 returns the single object reference to the Computer Science department: Q6: element  ( select  D from  D in DEPARTMENTS where  D.Dname  = ‘Computer Science’ ); Since a department name is unique across all departments, the result should be one department. The type of the result is D:DEPARTMENT . Collection Operators (Aggregate Functions, Quantifiers). Because many query expressions specify collections as their result, a number of operators have been defined that are applied to such collections.\n",
      "\n",
      "These include aggregate operators as well as membership and quantification (universal and existential) over a collection. The aggregate operators ( min, max, count , sum, avg) operate over a collection.41 The operator count  returns an integer type. The remaining aggregate operators ( min, max, sum, avg) return the same type as the type of the operand collection. Two examples follow. The query Q7 returns the number of students minoring in Com- puter Science and Q8 returns the average GPA of all seniors majoring in Computer Science.\n",
      "\n",
      "41These correspond to aggregate functions in SQL.414 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases Q7: count  ( S in Has_minors( ‘Computer Science’ )); Q8: avg ( select  S.Gpa from  S in STUDENTS where  S.Majors_in.Dname  = ‘Computer Science’ and S.Class  = ‘Senior’ ); Notice that aggregate operations can be applied to any collection of the appropriate type and can be used in any part of a query.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the query to retrieve all department names that have more than 100 majors can be written as in Q9: Q9: select  D.Dname from  D in DEPARTMENTS where  count  (D.Has_majors)  > 100; The membership  and quantification  expressions return a Boolean type—that is, true or false.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let V be a variable, C a collection expression, B an expression of type Boolean (that is, a Boolean condition), and E an element of the type of elements in collection C. Then: (E in C) returns true if element E is a member of collection C. (for all  V in C : B) returns true if all the elements of collection C satisfy B. (exists  V in C : B) returns true if there is at least one element in C satisfying B.\n",
      "\n",
      "To illustrate the membership condition, suppose we want to retrieve the names of all students who completed the course called ‘Database Systems I’.\n",
      "\n",
      "This can be writ-ten as in Q10, where the nested query returns the collection of course names that each STUDENT  S has completed, and the membership condition returns true if ‘Database Systems I’ is in the collection for a particular STUDENT  S: Q10:  select  S.name.Lname, S.name.Fname from  S in STUDENTS where  ‘Database Systems I’ in ( select  C.Section.Of_course.Cname from  C in S.Completed_sections); Q10 also illustrates a simpler way to specify the select  clause of queries that return a collection of structs; the type returned by Q10 is bag<struct (string , string )>.\n",
      "\n",
      "One can also write queries that return true/false results. As an example, let us assume that there is a named object called JEREMY  of type STUDENT .

      "\n",
      "12.6  Overview of the C++ Language Binding   in the OD MG Standard The C++ language binding specifies how ODL constructs are mapped to C++ con- structs. This is done via a C++ class library that provides classes and operations that implement the ODL constructs. An object manipulation language (OML) is needed to specify how database objects are retrieved and manipulated within a C++ program, and this is based on the C++ programming language syntax and semantics.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the ODL/OML bindings, a set of constructs called physi- cal pragmas  are defined to allow the programmer some control over physical stor- age issues, such as clustering of objects, utilizing indexes, and memory management. The class library added to C++ for the ODMG standard uses the prefix d_ for class declarations that deal with database concepts.42 The goal is that the pro- grammer should think that only one language is being used, not two separate languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the programmer to refer to database objects in a program, a class D_Ref <T> is defined for each database class T in the schema. Hence, program variables of type D_Ref <T> can refer to both persistent and transient objects of class T. In order to utilize the various built-in types in the ODMG object model such as collection types, various template classes are specified in the library. For example, an abstract class D_Object <T> specifies the operations to be inherited by all objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, an abstract class D_Collection <T> specifies the operations of collections. These classes are not instantiable, but only specify the operations that can be inherited by all objects and by collection objects, respectively. A template class is specified for each type of collection; these include D_Set <T>, D_List <T>, D_Bag <T>, D_Varray <T>, and D_Dictionary <T>, and they correspond to the collection types in the object model (see Section 12.3.1).\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, the programmer can create classes of types such as D_Set <D_Ref <STUDENT >> whose instances would be sets of references to STUDENT  objects, or D_Set <string > whose instances would be sets of strings. Additionally, a class d_Iterator  corresponds to the Iterator  class of the object model. The C++ ODL allows a user to specify the classes of a database schema using the constructs of C++ as well as the constructs provided by the object database library.\n",
      "\n",
      "For specifying the data types of attributes,43 basic types such as d_Short (short integer), d_Ushort  (unsigned short integer), d_Long  (long integer), and d_Float  (floating-point number) are provided. In addition to the basic data types, several structured literal types are provided to correspond to the structured literal types of the ODMG object model. These include d_String , d_Interval , d_Date,  d_Time , and d_Timestamp  (see Figure 12.5(b)).\n",

      "43That is, member variables  in object-oriented programming terminology.418 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases To specify relationships, the keyword rel_ is used within the prefix of type names; for example, by writing d_Rel_Ref<DEPARTMENT , Has_majors> Majors_in ; in the STUDENT  class, and d_Rel_Set<STUDENT , Majors_in> Has_majors ; in the DEPARTMENT  class, we are declaring that Majors_in  and Has_majors  are rela- tionship properties that are inverses of one another and hence represent a 1:N binary relationship between DEPARTMENT  and STUDENT .\n",
      "\n",
      "For the OML, the binding overloads the operation new so that it can be used to create either persistent or transient objects. To create persistent objects, one must provide the database name and the persistent name of the object. For example, by writing D_Ref<STUDENT>  S = new(DB1, ‘John_Smith’) STUDENT ; the programmer creates a named persistent object of type STUDENT  in database DB1  with persistent name John_Smith . Another operation, delete_object () can be used to delete objects.\n",

      "Object modification is done by the operations (methods) defined in each class by the programmer. The C++ binding also allows the creation of extents by using the library class d_Extent . For example, by writing D_Extent<PERSON> ALL_PERSONS (DB1); the programmer would create a named collection object ALL_PERSONS —whose type would be D_Set <PERSON >—in the database DB1  that would hold persistent objects of type PERSON .\n",
      "\n",
      "However, key constraints are not supported in the C++ binding, and any key checks must be programmed in the class methods.44 Also, the C++ binding does not support persistence via reachability; the object must be statically declared to be persistent at the time it is created.\n",

      "12.7 Summary   In this chapter, we started in Section 12.1 with an overview of the concepts utilized in object databases, and we discussed how these concepts were derived from gen-eral object-oriented principles. The main concepts we discussed were: object iden-tity and identifiers; encapsulation of operations; inheritance; complex structure of objects through nesting of type constructors; and how objects are made persistent. 44We have only provided a brief overview of the C++ binding. For full details, see Cattell et al.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2000), Chapter 5. 12.7 Summary  419 Then, in Section 12.2, we showed how many of these concepts were incorporated into the relational model and the SQL standard; we showed that this incorporation leads to expanded relational database functionality. These systems have been called object-relational databases. We then discussed the ODMG 3.0 standard for object databases. We started by describing the various constructs of the object model in Sction 12.3.\n",
      "\n",
      "The various built-in types, such as Object , Collection , Iterator , set, list, and so on, were described by their interfaces, which specify the built-in operations of each type. These built-in types are the foundation upon which the object definition language (ODL) and object query language (OQL) are based. We also described the difference between objects, which have an ObjectId, and literals, which are values with no OID. Users can declare classes for their application that inherit operations from the appropriate built-in interfaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two types of properties can be specified in a user-defined class—attributes and relationships—in addition to the operations that can be applied to objects of the class. The ODL allows users to specify both interfaces and classes, and permits two different types of inheritance—interface inheritance via “:” and class inheritance via extends . A class can have an extent and keys. A description of ODL followed, and an example database schema for the UNIVERSITY  database was used to illustrate the ODL constructs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the description of the ODMG object model, we described a general tech- nique for designing object database schemas in Section 12.4. We discussed how object databases differ from relational databases in three main areas: references to represent relationships, inclusion of operations, and inheritance. Finally, we showed how to map a conceptual database design in the EER model to the con-structs of object databases. In Section 12.5, we presented an overview of the object query language (OQL).\n",
      "\n",
      "The OQL follows the concept of orthogonality in constructing queries, meaning that an operation can be applied to the result of another operation as long as the type of the result is of the correct input type for the operation. The OQL syntax follows many of the constructs of SQL but includes additional concepts such as path expressions, inheritance, methods, relationships, and collections. Examples of how to use OQL over the UNIVERSITY  database were given.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next we gave an overview of the C++ language binding in Section 12.6, which extends C++ class declarations with the ODL type constructors but permits seam-less integration of C++ with the ODBMS. In 1997 Sun endorsed the ODMG API (Application Program Interface). O2 tech- nologies was the first corporation to deliver an ODMG-compliant DBMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many ODBMS vendors, including Object Design (now eXcelon), Gemstone Systems, POET Software, and Versant Corporation 45, have endorsed the ODMG standard. 45The Versant Object Technology product now belongs to Actian Corporation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The information stored in relational databases is known as structured data  because it is represented in a strict format. For example, each record in a relational database table—such as each of the tables in the COMPANY  database in Figure 5.6—follows the same format as the other records. For structured data, it is common to carefully design the database schema using techniques such as those described in Chapters 3 and 4 in order to define the database structure. The DBMS then checks to ensure that all data follows the structures and constraints specified in the schema.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, not all data is collected and inserted into carefully designed structured databases. In some applications, data is collected in an ad hoc manner before it is known how it will be stored and managed. This data may have a certain structure, but not all the information collected will have the identical structure. Some attri-butes may be shared among the various entities, but other attributes may exist only in a few entities. Moreover, additional attributes can be introduced in some of the newer data items at any time, and there is no predefined schema.\n",
      "\n",
      "This type of data is known as semistructured data . A number of data models have been introduced  13.1 Structured, Semistructured, and Unstructured Data  427 for representing semistructured data, often based on using tree or graph data struc- tures rather than the flat relational model structures. A key difference between structured and semistructured data concerns how the schema constructs (such as the names of attributes, relationships, and entity types) are handled.\n",
      "\n",
      "In semistructured data, the schema information is mixed in  with the data values, since each data object can have different attributes that are not known in advance. Hence, this type of data is sometimes referred to as self-describing data . Many of the newer NOSQL systems adopt self-describing storage schemes (see Chapter 24). Consider the following example. We want to collect a list of bib-liographic references related to a certain research project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of these may be books or technical reports, others may be research articles in journals or conference proceedings, and still others may refer to complete journal issues or conference proceedings. Clearly, each of these may have different attributes and different types of information. Even for the same type of reference—say, conference articles—we may have different information. For example, one article citation may be com-plete, with full information about author names, title, proceedings, page numbers, and so on, whereas another citation may not have all the information available.\n",
      "\n",
      "New types of bibliographic sources may appear in the future—for instance, references to Web pages or to conference tutorials—and these may have new attributes that describe them. One model for displaying semistructured data is a directed graph, as shown in Figure 13.1. The information shown in Figure 13.1 corresponds to some of the structured data shown in Figure 5.6. As we can see, this model somewhat resem-bles the object model (see Section 12.1.3) in its ability to represent complex objects and nested structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Figure 13.1, the labels  or tags  on the directed edges represent the schema names: the names of attributes, object types ( or entity types or classes ), and relationships . The internal nodes represent individual objects or composite attributes. The leaf nodes represent actual data values of simple (atomic) attributes. There are two main differences between the semistructured model and the object model that we discussed in Chapter 12: 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "The schema information—names of attributes, relationships, and classes (object types) in the semistructured model—is intermixed with the objects and their data values in the same data structure. 2. In the semistructured model, there is no requirement for a predefined schema to which the data objects must conform, although it is possible to define a schema if necessary. The object model of Chapter 12 requires a schema.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to structured and semistructured data, a third category exists, known as unstructured data  because there is very limited indication of the type of data. A typical example is a text document that contains information embedded within it. Web pages in HTML that contain some data are considered to be unstructured data. Consider part of an HTML file, shown in Figure 13.2. Text that appears between angled brackets, <…>, is an HTML tag .\n",
      "\n",
      "A tag with a slash, </…>, indicates an end tag , which represents the ending of the effect of a matching start tag . The tags mark up  the document 1 in order to instruct an HTML processor how to dis- play the text between a start tag and a matching end tag. Hence, the tags specify document formatting rather than the meaning of the various data elements in the document. HTML tags specify information, such as font size and style (boldface, italics, and so on), color, heading levels in documents, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some tags provide text structuring in documents, such as specifying a numbered or unnumbered list or a table. Even these structuring tags specify that the embedded textual data is to be displayed in a certain manner rather than indicating the type of data represented in the table. HTML uses a large number of predefined tags, which are used to specify a variety of commands for formatting Web documents for display. The start and end tags spec-ify the range of text to be formatted by each command.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few examples of the tags shown in Figure 13.2 follow: ■The < HTML > … < /HTML > tags specify the boundaries of the document. ■The document header  information—within the < HEAD > … < /HEAD > tags—specifies various commands that will be used elsewhere in the docu-ment.

      "There are many heading levels (< H2>, <H3>, and so on), each displaying text in a less prominent heading format. ■The < TABLE > … < /TABLE > tags specify that the following text is to be dis- played as a table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each table row  in the table is enclosed within < TR> … < /TR> 430 Chapter 13 XML: Extensible Markup Language tags, and the individual table data elements in a row are displayed within <TD> … < /TD> tags.2 ■Some tags may have attributes , which appear within the start tag and describe additional properties of the tag.3 In Figure 13.2, the < TABLE > start tag has four attributes describing various charac- teristics of the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following < TD> and < FONT > start tags have one and two attributes, respectively. HTML has a very large number of predefined tags, and whole books are devoted to describing how to use these tags. If designed properly, HTML documents can be formatted so that humans are able to easily understand the document contents and are able to navigate through the resulting Web documents. However, the source HTML text documents are very difficult to interpret automatically by computer pro- grams  because they do not include schema information about the type of data in the documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "As e-commerce and other Internet applications become increasingly automated, it is becoming crucial to be able to exchange Web documents among various computer sites and to interpret their contents automatically. This need was one of the reasons that led to the development of XML. In addition, an extendible version of HTML called XHTML was developed that allows users to extend the tags of HTML for different applications and allows an XHTML file to be interpreted by standard XML processing programs. Our discussion will focus on XML only.\n",
      "\n",
      "The example in Figure 13.2 illustrates a static  HTML page, since all the information to be displayed is explicitly spelled out as fixed text in the HTML file. In many cases, some of the information to be displayed may be extracted from a database. For example, the project names and the employees working on each project may be extracted from the database in Figure 5.6 through the appropriate SQL query. We may want to use the same HTML formatting tags for displaying each project and the employees who work on it, but we may want to change the particular projects (and employees) being displayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we may want to see a Web page displaying the information for ProjectX , and then later a page displaying the information for ProjectY . Although both pages are displayed using the same HTML formatting tags, the actual data items displayed will be different. Such Web pages are called dynamic , since the data parts of the page may be different each time it is displayed, even though the display appearance is the same. We discussed in Chapter 11 how scripting lan- guages, such as PHP, can be used to generate dynamic Web pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "13.2 X ML Hierarchical (Tree) Data Model We now introduce the data model used in XML. The basic object in XML is the XML document. Two main structuring concepts are used to construct an XML document: elements  and attributes . It is important to note that the term attribute  in XML is not 2<TR> stands for table row and <TD> stands for table data. 3This is how the term attribute  is used in document markup languages, which differs from how it is used in database models.\n",

There are addi- tional concepts in XML, such as entities, identifiers, and references, but first we concen-trate on describing elements and attributes to show the essence of the XML model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 13.3 shows an example of an XML element called <Projects> . As in HTML, elements are identified in a document by their start tag and end tag. The tag names are enclosed between angled brackets < … >, and end tags are further identified by a slash, </ … >. 5 Complex elements  are constructed from other elements hierarchically, whereas simple elements  contain data values. A major difference between XML and HTML is that XML tag names are defined to describe the meaning of the data elements in the document rather than to describe how the text is to be displayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This makes it possible to process the data elements in the XML document automatically by com-puter programs. Also, the XML tag (element) names can be defined in another doc-ument, known as the schema document , to give a semantic meaning to the tag names that can be exchanged among multiple programs and users. In HTML, all tag names are predefined and fixed; that is why they are not extendible. It is straightforward to see the correspondence between the XML textual representa- tion shown in Figure 13.3 and the tree structure shown in Figure 13.1.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the tree representation, internal nodes represent complex elements, whereas leaf nodes rep-resent simple elements. That is why the XML model is called a tree model  or a hierarchical model . In Figure 13.3, the simple elements are the ones with the tag names <Name> , <Number> , <Location> , <Dept_no> , <Ssn> , <Last_name> , <First_name> , and <Hours> . The complex elements are the ones with the tag names <Projects> , <Project> , and <Worker> .\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, there is no limit on the levels of nesting of elements. It is possible to characterize three main types of XML documents: ■Data-centric XML documents. These documents have many small data items that follow a specific structure and hence may be extracted from a structured database. They are formatted as XML documents in order to exchange them over the Web. These usually follow a predefined schema  that defines the tag names. ■Document-centric XML documents. These are documents with large amounts of text, such as news articles or books.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are few or no struc-tured data elements in these documents. ■Hybrid XML documents. These documents may have parts that contain structured data and other parts that are predominantly textual or unstruc- tured. They may or may not have a predefined schema. 4SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) is a more general language for describing documents and provides capabilities for specifying new tags. However, it is more complex than HTML and XML.\n",

It is impor- tant to note that data-centric XML documents can be considered either as semistructured data or as structured data as defined in Section 13.1. If an XML document conforms to a predefined XML schema or DTD (see Section 13.3), then the document can be considered as structured data .\n",

It is also possible to use XML attributes to hold the values of simple data elements; however, this is generally not recom- mended. An exception to this rule is in cases that need to reference  another ele- ment in another part of the XML document. To do this, it is common to use attribute values in one element as the references.\n",

In particular, it must start with an XML declaration  to indicate the version of XML being used as well as any other relevant attributes, as shown in the first line in Figure 13.3. It must also follow the syntactic guidelines of the tree data model.\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that there should be a single root element , and every element must include a matching pair of start and end tags within  the start and end tags of the parent element . This ensures that the nested ele- ments specify a well-formed tree structure. A well-formed XML document is syntactically correct. This allows it to be pro- cessed by generic processors that traverse the document and create an internal tree representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "A standard model with an associated set of API (application pro-gramming interface) functions called DOM  (Document Object Model) allows pro- grams to manipulate the resulting tree representation corresponding to a well-formed XML document. However, the whole document must be parsed beforehand when using DOM in order to convert the document to that standard DOM internal data structure representation. Another API called SAX  (Simple API for XML) allows processing of XML documents on the fly by notifying the process-ing program through callbacks whenever a start or end tag is encountered.\n",
      "\n",
      "This makes it easier to process large documents and allows for processing of so-called streaming XML documents , where the processing program can process the tags as they are encountered. This is also known as event-based processing . There are also other specialized processors that work with various programming and scripting languages for parsing XML documents. A well-formed XML document can be schemaless; that is, it can have any tag names for the elements within the document.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, there is no predefined 434 Chapter 13 XML: Extensible Markup Language set of elements (tag names) that a program processing the document knows to expect. This gives the document creator the freedom to specify new elements but limits the possibilities for automatically interpreting the meaning or semantics of the elements within the document. A stronger criterion is for an XML document to be valid . In this case, the document must be well formed, and it must follow a particular schema.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is, the element names used in the start and end tag pairs must follow the structure specified in a separate XML DTD  (Document Type Definition ) file or XML schema file . We first discuss XML DTD here, and then we give an overview of XML schema in Sec-tion 13.3.2. Figure 13.4 shows a simple XML DTD file, which specifies the elements (tag names) and their nested structures. Any valid documents conforming to this DTD should follow the specified structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "A special syntax exists for specifying DTD files, as illustrated in Figure 13.4(a). First, a name is given to the root tag  of the document, which is called Projects  in the first line in Figure 13.4. Then the ele- ments and their nested structure are specified. When specifying elements, the following notation is used: ■A * following the element name means that the element can be repeated zero or more times in the document. This kind of element is known as an optional multivalued (repeating) element.\n",
      "\n",
      "■A + following the element name means that the element can be repeated one or more times in the document.

If the parentheses include names of other elements, these latter elements are the children  of the element in the tree structure. If the parentheses include the keyword #PCDATA  or one of the other data types available in XML DTD, the element is a leaf node. PCDATA  stands for parsed character data , which is roughly similar to a string data type. ■The list of attributes that can appear within an element can also be specified via the keyword !ATTLIST .\n",

      "In Figure 13.3, the Project  element has an attribute ProjId . If the type of an attribute is ID, then it can be referenced from another attribute whose type is IDREF  within another element.

Although XML DTD is adequate for specifying tree structures with required, optional, and repeating elements, and with various types of attributes, it has several limitations. First, the data types in DTD are not very general.\n",

      "Second, DTD has its own special syntax and thus requires specialized processors. It would be advanta-geous to specify XML schema documents using the syntax rules of XML itself so that the same processors used for XML documents could process XML schema descriptions. Third, all DTD elements are always forced to follow the specified ordering of the document, so unordered elements are not permitted.

Next, we specify the root element  of our XML schema.\n",

      "In XML schema, the name  attribute of the xsd:element  tag specifies the ele- ment name, which is called company  for the root element in our example (see Figure 13.5).

This is further specified to be a sequence of departments, employees, and projects using the xsd:sequence structure of XML schema.\n",

      "It is important to note here that this is not the only way to specify an XML schema for the COMPANY  database. We will discuss other options in Section 13.6. 4. First-level elements in the COMPANY  database. Next, we specify the three first-level elements under the company  root element in Figure 13.5.

      "\n",
      "In XML schema, the attributes type, minOccurs,  and maxOccurs  in the xsd:element tag specify the type and multiplicity of each element in any document that conforms to the schema specifications. If we specify a type attribute in an xsd:element , the structure of the element must be described separately, typi- cally using the xsd:complexType  element of XML schema. This is illustrated by the employee , department , and project  elements in Figure 13.5.\n",

      "On the other hand, if no type attribute is specified, the element structure can be defined directly following the tag, as illustrated by the company  root element in Fig- ure 13.5.

In XML schema, it is possible to specify constraints that correspond to unique and primary key constraints in a relational database (see Section 5.2.2), as well as foreign keys (or referential integrity) con-straints (see Section 5.2.4). The xsd:unique  tag specifies elements that cor- respond to unique attributes in a relational database.\n",

      "When specifying a foreign key, the attribute refer of the xsd:keyref  tag specifies the referenced primary key, whereas the tags xsd:selector  and xsd:field  specify the referencing element type and foreign key (see Figure 13.5). 7. Specifying the structures of complex elements via complex types. The next part of our example specifies the structures of the complex elements Department , Employee , Project , and Dependent , using the tag xsd:complexType (see Figure 13.5).\n",

There are other features, but they are beyond the scope of our presentation.

      "\n",
      "13.4  Storing and Extracting X ML Documents from Databases Several approaches to organizing the contents of XML documents to facilitate their subsequent querying and retrieval have been proposed. The following are the most common approaches: 1. Using a file system or a DBMS to store the documents as text. An XML document can be stored as a text file within a traditional file system. Alter-natively, a relational DBMS can be used to store whole XML documents as text fields within the DBMS recordss.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach can be used if the DBMS has a special module for document processing, and it would work for storing schemaless and document-centric XML documents. 2. Using a DBMS to store the document contents as data elements. This approach would work for storing a collection of documents that follow a specific XML DTD or XML schema. Because all the documents have the same structure, one can design a relational database to store the leaf-level data elements within the XML documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach would require mapping algorithms to design a database schema that is compatible with the XML document structure as specified in the XML schema or DTD and to re-create the XML documents from the stored data. These algorithms can be implemented either as an internal DBMS module or as separate middleware that is not part of the DBMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "If all elements in an XML document have IDs, a simple representation would be to have a table with attributes XDOC(CId, PId, Etag, Val) where CID and PId are the parent and child element IDs, Etag is the name of the element of the Cid, and Val is the value if it is a leaf node, assuming all values are the same type. 3. Designing a specialized system for storing native XML data. A new type of database system based on the hierarchical (tree) model could be designed and implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such systems are referred to as native XML DBMS s. The system would include specialized indexing and querying techniques and would work for all types of XML documents. It could also include data com-pression techniques to reduce the size of the documents for storage. Tamino by Software AG and the Dynamic Application Platform of eXcelon are two popular products that offer native XML DBMS capability. Oracle also offers a native XML storage option. 4. Creating or publishing customized XML documents from preexisting relational databases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because there are enormous amounts of data already stored in relational databases, parts of this data may need to be formatted as documents for exchanging or displaying over the Web. This approach would use a separate middleware software layer to handle the conversions needed between the relational data and the extracted XML documents. Section 13.6 discusses this approach, in which data-centric XML documents are extracted from existing databases, in more detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "In particular, we show how tree structured documents can be created from flat relational databases that have  13.5 XML Languages  443 been designed using the ER graph-structured data model. Section 13.6.2 discusses the problem of cycles and how to deal with it. All of these approaches have received considerable attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "We focus on the fourth approach in Section 13.6, because it gives a good conceptual understanding of the differences between the XML tree data model and the traditional database models based on flat files (relational model) and graph representations (ER model). But first we give an overview of XML query languages in Section 13.5.\n",

      "13.5 X ML Languages There have been several proposals for XML query languages, and two query language standards have emerged. The first is XPath , which provides language constructs for specifying path expressions to identify certain nodes (elements) or attributes within an XML document that match specific patterns. The second is XQuery , which is a more general query language. XQuery uses XPath expressions but has additional con-structs. We give an overview of each of these languages in this section.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we dis-cuss some additional languages related to HTML in Section 13.5.3.\n",
      "\n",
      "13.5.1 XPath: Specifying Path Expressions in XML An XPath  expression generally returns a sequence of items that satisfy a certain pat- tern as specified by the expression. These items are either values (from leaf nodes) or elements or attributes. The most common type of XPath  expression returns a col- lection of element or attribute nodes that satisfy certain patterns specified in the expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "The names in the XPath  expression are node names in the XML docu- ment tree that are either tag (element) names or attribute names, possibly with additional qualifier conditions  to further restrict the nodes that satisfy the pattern. Two main separators  are used when specifying a path: single slash (/) and double slash (//). A single slash before a tag specifies that the tag must appear as a direct child of the previous (parent) tag, whereas a double slash specifies that the tag can appear as a descendant of the previous tag at any level .\n",
      "\n",
      "To refer to an attribute name instead of an element (tag) name, the prefix @ is used before the attribute name. Let us look at some examples of XPath as shown in Figure 13.6. The first XPath expression in Figure 13.6 returns the company  root node and all its descendant nodes, which means that it returns the whole XML document. We should note that it is customary to include the file name in the XPath  query. This allows us to specify any local file name or even any path name that specifies a file on the Web.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if the COMPANY  XML document is stored at the location www.company.com/info.XML then the first XPath expression in Figure 13.6 can be written as doc(www.company.com/info.XML )/company This prefix would also be included in the other examples of XPath  expressions.444 Chapter 13 XML: Extensible Markup Language The second example in Figure 13.6 returns all department nodes (elements) and their descendant subtrees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that the nodes (elements) in an XML document are ordered, so the XPath  result that returns multiple nodes will do so in the same order in which the nodes are ordered in the document tree. The third XPath  expression in Figure 13.6 illustrates the use of //, which is conve- nient to use if we do not know the full path name we are searching for, but we do know the name of some tags of interest within the XML document. This is particu- larly useful for schemaless XML documents or for documents with many nested levels of nodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "6 The expression returns all employeeName  nodes that are direct children of an employee  node, such that the employee  node has another child element employeeSalary whose value is greater than 70000 . This illustrates the use of qualifier conditions, which restrict the nodes selected by the XPath  expression to those that satisfy the condition. XPath  has a number of comparison operations for use in qualifier condi- tions, including standard arithmetic, string, and set comparison operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth XPath  expression in Figure 13.6 should return the same result as the pre- vious one, except that we specified the full path name in this example. The fifth expression in Figure 13.6 returns all projectWorker  nodes and their descendant nodes that are children under a path /company/project  and have a child node, hours, with a value greater than\n",
      "\n",
      "20.0 hours. When we need to include attributes in an XPath  expression, the attribute name is prefixed by the @ symbol to distinguish it from element (tag) names. It is also pos- sible to use the wildcard  symbol *, which stands for any element, as in the following example, which retrieves all elements that are child elements of the root, regardless of their element type. When wildcards are used, the result can be a sequence of dif-ferent types of elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "/company/* The examples above illustrate simple XPath  expressions, where we can only move down in the tree structure from a given node. A more general model for path expressions has been proposed. In this model, it is possible to move in multiple directions from the current node in the path expression.

      "\n",
      "Our examples above used only three of these axes : child of the current node (/), descendent or self at any level of the current node (//), and attribute of the current node (@). Other axes include parent, ancestor (at any level), previous sibling (a node at same level to the left), and next sibling (a node at the same level to the right). These axes allow for more complex path expressions. The main restriction of XPath  path expressions is that the path that specifies the pat- tern also specifies the items to be retrieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, it is difficult to specify certain conditions on the pattern while separately specifying which result items should be retrieved. The XQuery  language separates these two concerns and provides more powerful constructs for specifying queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "13.5.2 XQuery: Specifying Queries in XML XPath  allows us to write expressions that select items from a tree-structured XML document. XQuery  permits the specification of more general queries on one or more XML documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "The typical form of a query in XQuery  is known as a FLWOR expression , which stands for the five main clauses of XQuery  and has the following form: FOR <variable bindings to individual nodes (elements)> LET <variable bindings to collections of nodes (elements)>WHERE <qualifier conditions>ORDER BY <ordering specifications>RETURN <query result specification> There can be zero or more instances of the FOR  clause, as well as of the LET clause in a single XQuery .\n",
      "\n",
      "The WHERE  and ORDER BY clauses are optional but can appear at most once, and the RETURN  clause must appear exactly once. Let us illustrate these clauses with the following simple example of an XQuery .\n",

Variables are prefixed with the $ sign.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the above example, $d, $x, and $y are variables. The LET clause assigns a variable to a particular expression for the rest of the query. In this example, $d is assigned to the document file name. It is possible to have a query that refers to multiple documents by assigning multiple variables in this way. 2. The FOR  clause assigns a variable to range over each of the individual ele- ments in a sequence. In our example, the sequences are specified by path expressions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The $x variable ranges over elements that satisfy the path expres- sion $d/company/project[projectNumber = 5]/projectWorker. The $y variable 446 Chapter 13 XML: Extensible Markup Language ranges over elements that satisfy the path expression $d/company/employee . Hence, $x ranges over projectWorker  elements for workers who work in proj- ect 5, whereas $y ranges over employee  elements. 3. The WHERE  clause specifies additional conditions on the selection of items.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, the first condition selects only those projectWorker  elements that satisfy the condition (hours gt 20.0) . The second condition specifies a join condition that combines an employee  with a projectWorker  only if they have the same ssn value. 4. The ORDER BY  clause specifies that the result elements will be ordered by the value of the hours per week they work on the project in ascending value of hours. 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the RETURN  clause specifies which elements or attributes should be retrieved from the items that satisfy the query conditions. In this example, it will return a sequence of elements each containing <firstName, lastName, hours> for employees who work more that 20 hours per week on project number 5. Figure 13.7 includes some additional examples of queries in XQuery  that can be specified on an XML instance documents that follow the XML schema document in Figure 13.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first query retrieves the first and last names of employees who earn more than $70,000. The variable $x is bound to each employeeName  element that is a child of an employee  element, but only for employee  elements that satisfy the qualifier that their employeeSalary  value is greater than $70,000. The result retrieves the firstName  and lastName  child elements of the selected employeeName elements. The second query is an alternative way of retrieving the same elements retrieved by the first query.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third query illustrates how a join operation can be performed by using more than one variable. Here, the $x variable is bound to each projectWorker  element that is a child of project number 5, whereas the $y variable is bound to each employee element. The join condition matches ssn values in order to retrieve the employee names. Notice that this is an alternative way of specifying the same query in our earlier example, but without the LET clause . XQuery  has very powerful constructs to specify complex queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "In particular, it can specify universal and existential quantifiers in the conditions of a query, aggregate functions, ordering of query results, selection based on position in a sequence, and even conditional branching.

XMLATTRIBUTES: This allows the creation of attributes for the elements of the XML result.\n",

We described the XML standard and its tree-structured (hierarchical) data model, and we discussed XML documents and the languages for specifying the structure of these documents, namely, XML DTD (Document Type Definition) and XML schema. We gave an overview of the various approaches for storing XML docu-ments, whether in their native (text) format, in a compressed form, or in relational and other types of databases.\n",

Finally, we discussed SQL/XML, which provides SQL with additional functionality to format SQL query results as XML data.\n",
      "\n",
      "﻿ Before discussing the formal theory of relational database design, we discuss four informal guidelines  that may be used as measures to determine the quality  of relation schema design: ■Making sure that the semantics of the attributes is clear in the schema ■Reducing the redundant information in tuples ■Reducing the NULL  values in tuples ■Disallowing the possibility of generating spurious tuples These measures are not always independent of one another, as we will see.\n",
      "\n",
      "14.1.1 Imparting Clear Semantics to Attributes in Relations Whenever we group attributes to form a relation schema, we assume that attri- butes belonging to one relation have certain real-world meaning and a proper interpretation associated with them. The semantics  of a relation refers to its mean- ing resulting from the interpretation of attribute values in a tuple. In Chapter 5 we discussed how a relation can be interpreted as a set of facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the conceptual design described in Chapters 3 and 4 is done carefully and the mapping procedure in Chapter 9 is followed systematically, the relational schema design should have a clear meaning.462 Chapter 14 Basics of Functional Dependencies and Normalization for Relational Databases In general, the easier it is to explain the semantics of the relation—or in other words, what a relation exactly means and stands for—the better the relation schema design will be.\n",
      "\n",
      "To illustrate this, consider Figure 14.1, a simplified version of the COMPANY relational database schema in Figure 5.5, and Figure 14.2, which presents an example of populated relation states of this schema. The meaning of the EMPLOYEE  relation schema is simple: Each tuple represents an employee, with values for the employee’s name ( Ename ), Social Security number ( Ssn), birth date ( Bdate ), and address (Address ), and the number of the department that the employee works for ( Dnumber ).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dnumber  attribute is a foreign key that represents an implicit relationship  between EMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT . The semantics of the DEPARTMENT  and PROJECT schemas are also straightforward: Each DEPARTMENT  tuple represents a department entity, and each PROJECT  tuple represents a project entity. The attribute Dmgr_ssn  of DEPARTMENT  relates a department to the employee who is its manager, whereas Dnum  of PROJECT  relates a project to its controlling department; both are foreign key attributes.\n",

      "\n",
      "As an example, consider the following non-1NF relation: PERSON (Ss#, {Car_lic#}, {Phone#}) This relation represents the fact that a person has multiple cars and multiple phones. If strategy 2 above is followed, it results in an all-key relation: PERSON_IN_1NF (Ss#, Car_lic#, Phone#) To avoid introducing any extraneous relationship between Car_lic#  and Phone# , all possible combinations of values are represented for every Ss#, giving rise to redun- dancy.\n",

We also say that there is a functional dependency from X to Y, or that Y is functionally dependent  on X. The abbreviation for functional dependency is FD or f.d.\n",

      "\n",
      "Note the following: ■If a constraint on R states that there cannot be more than one tuple with a given X-value in any relation instance r(R)—that is, X is a candidate key  of R—this implies that X → Y for any subset of attributes Y of R (because the key constraint implies that no two tuples in any legal state r(R) will have the same value of X).\n",

Designers and users must either already know them or discover them as a part of the business.\n",

      "14.3.3 Definitions of Keys and Attributes Participating in Keys Before proceeding further, let’s look again at the definitions of keys of a relation schema from Chapter 3. Definition. A superkey  of a relation schema R = {A 1, A2, … , An} is a set of attri- butes S ⊆ R with the property that no two tuples t1 and t2 in any legal relation state r of R will have t1[S] = t2[S].\n",

In Figure 14.1, { Ssn} is a key for EMPLOYEE , whereas { Ssn}, {Ssn, Ename }, {Ssn, Ename , Bdate }, and any set of attributes that includes Ssn are all superkeys.\n",

      "If a relation schema has more than one key, each is called a candidate key . One of the candidate keys is arbitrarily  designated to be the primary key , and the others are called secondary keys. In a practical relational database, each relation schema must have a primary key. If no candidate key is known for a relation, the entire rela-tion can be treated as a default superkey. In Figure 14.1, { Ssn} is the only candidate key for EMPLOYEE , so it is also the primary key. Definition.\n",

      "An attribute of relation schema R is called a prime attribute  of R if it is a member of some candidate key  of R. An attribute is called nonprime  if it is not a prime attribute—that is, if it is not a member of any candidate key. In Figure 14.1, both Ssn and Pnumber  are prime attributes of WORKS_ON , whereas other attributes of WORKS_ON  are nonprime. We now present the first three normal forms: 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.\n",

As we shall see, 2NF and 3NF independently attack different types of problems arising from problematic functional dependencies among attributes. However, for histori- cal reasons, it is customary to follow them in that sequence; hence, by definition a 3NF relation already satisfies  2NF.\n",

      "14.3.4 First Normal Form First normal form (1NF )is now considered to be part of the formal definition of a relation in the basic (flat) relational model; historically, it was defined to disallow multivalued attributes, composite attributes, and their combinations.

We provided a treatment of successive normalization based on a predefined pri-mary key in each relation, and we then relaxed this requirement and provided more\n",

This process was described as normalization , and we showed how to achieve the first through third normal forms (1NF through 3NF) given pri-mary keys in Section 14.3.\n",

Typically, the schema designer specifies the functional dependencies that are semantically obvious ; usually, however, numerous other functional dependencies hold in all legal relation instances among sets of attributes that can be derived from and satisfy the dependencies in F. Those other dependencies can be inferred  or deduced  from the FDs in F. We call them as inferred or implied functional dependencies.\n",

In real life, it is impossible to specify all possible functional dependencies for a given situation.\n",

There is no fully satisfactory relational design theory as yet that includes NULL  values. One problem occurs when some tuples have NULL values for attributes that will be used to join individual relations in the decomposi- tion. To illustrate this, consider the database shown in Figure 15.2(a), where two relations EMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT  are shown.\n",

      "The last two employee tuples— ‘Berger’ and ‘Benitez’—represent newly hired employees who have not yet been assigned to a department (assume that this does not violate any integrity con-straints). Now suppose that we want to retrieve a list of ( Ename , Dname ) values for all the employees. If we apply the NATURAL JOIN  operation on EMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT  (Figure 15.2(b)), the two aforementioned tuples will not appear in the result.\n",

Recall that if we take the LEFT OUTER JOIN  of EMPLOYEE  with DEPARTMENT , tuples in EMPLOYEE  that have NULL  for the join attribute will still appear in the result, joined with an imaginary  tuple in DEPARTMENT  that has NULL s for all its attribute values. Figure 15.2(c) shows the result.\n",

This can cause unexpected loss of information in queries that involve joins on that foreign key. Moreover, if NULL s occur in other attributes, such as Salary , their effect on built-in functions such as SUM  and AVERAGE  must be carefully evaluated.\n",

      "A related problem is that of dangling tuples , which may occur if we carry a decom- position too far. Suppose that we decompose the EMPLOYEE  relation in Fig- ure 15.2(a) further into EMPLOYEE_1  and EMPLOYEE_2 , shown in Figures 15.3(a) and 15.3(b).\n",

Another problem is that these algorithms are not deterministic in general.\n",

Because there may be, in general, many minimal covers corresponding to F, as we illustrated in Example 2 of Algorithm 15.4 above, the algorithm can give different designs depending on the particular minimal cover used. Some of these designs may not be desirable.\n",

For example, if X = {A1, A2, … , An} and Y = {B1, B2, … , Bn}, one possible correspondence is to have dom( Ai) compatible with dom( Bi) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. In this case, we say that Ai corresponds to  Bi.\n",

IDIR3  (transitivity): If R.X < S.Y and S.Y < T.Z, then R.X < T.Z. The preceding inference rules were shown to be sound and complete for inclusion dependencies.\n",

      "For exam- ple, in the relation ORDER_LINE (Order#, Item#, Quantity, Unit_price, Extended_price, Discounted_price) each tuple represents an item from an order with a particular quantity, and the price per unit for that item. In this relation, ( Quantity , Unit_price  ) → Extended_price by the formula Extended_price = Unit_price  * Quantity Hence, there is a unique value for Extended_price  for every pair ( Quantity , Unit_price ), and thus it conforms to the definition of functional dependency.\n",

      "Moreover, there may be a procedure that takes into account the quantity discounts, the type of item, and so on and computes a discounted price for the total quantity ordered for that item. Therefore, we can say (Item#, Quantity, Unit_price )  → Discounted_price , or (Item#, Quantity, Extended_price)  → Discounted_price To check the above FDs, a more complex procedure COMPUTE_TOTAL_PRICE  may have to be called into play.\n",

      "The idea behind domain-key normal form  (DKNF ) is to specify (theoreti- cally, at least) the ultimate normal form  that takes into account all possible types of dependencies and constraints.

      "\n",
      "For a relation in DKNF, it becomes straightforward to enforce all database constraints by simply checking that each attribute value in a tuple is of the appro-priate domain and that every key constraint is enforced. However, because of the difficulty of including complex constraints in a DKNF relation, its practical utility is limited, since it may be quite difficult to specify gen-eral integrity constraints.\n",

There is no simplified way to represent such constraints short of writing a procedure (or general assertions) to test them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The procedure COMPUTE_TOTAL_PRICE above is an example of such procedures needed to enforce an appropriate integrity constraint. For these reasons, although the concept of DKNF is appealing and appears straight- forward, it cannot be directly tested or implemented with any guarantees of consis- tency or non-redundancy of design. Hence it is not used much in practice.\n",

This category includes storage media that can be operated on directly by the computer’s central processing unit  (CPU), such as the computer’s main memory and smaller but faster cache memories. Primary storage usually provides fast access to data but is of limited storage capacity.\n",

      "16.1.1 Memory Hierarchies and Storage Devices1 In a modern computer system, data resides and is transported throughout a hierar-chy of storage media. The highest-speed memory is the most expensive and is therefore available with the least capacity. The lowest-speed memory is offline tape storage, which is essentially available in indefinite storage capacity. At the primary storage level,  the memory hierarchy includes, at the most expensive end, cache memory , which is a static RAM (random access memory).\n",

      "Cache mem- ory is typically used by the CPU to speed up execution of program instructions using techniques such as prefetching and pipelining. The next level of primary stor-age is DRAM (dynamic RAM), which provides the main work area for the CPU for keeping program instructions and data. It is popularly called main memory . The advantage of DRAM is its low cost, which continues to decrease; the drawback is its volatility 2 and lower speed compared with static RAM.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the secondary and tertiary storage level,  the hierarchy includes magnetic disks; mass storage  in the form of CD-ROM (compact disk–read-only memory) and DVD (digital video disk or digital versatile disk) devices; and finally tapes at the least expensive end of the hierarchy. The storage capacity  is measured in kilobytes (Kbyte or 1,000 bytes), megabytes (MB or 1 million bytes), gigabytes (GB or 1 bil-lion bytes), and even terabytes (1,000 GB).\n",

      "The word petabyte  (1,000 terabytes or 10**15 bytes) is now becoming relevant in the context of very large repositories of data in physics, astronomy, earth sciences, and other scientific applications. Programs reside and execute in dynamic random-access memory ( DRAM ). Gen- erally, large permanent databases reside on secondary storage (magnetic disks), and portions of the database are read into and written from buffers in main memory as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nowadays, personal computers and workstations have large main memo-ries of hundreds of megabytes of RAM and DRAM, so it is becoming possible to load a large part of the database into main memory. Eight to sixteen GB of main memory is becoming commonplace on laptops, and servers with 256 GB capacity are not uncommon. In some cases, entire databases can be kept in main memory (with a backup copy on magnetic disk), which results in main memory databases ; these are particularly useful in real-time applications that require extremely fast response times.\n",

      "An example is telephone switching applications, which store data-bases that contain routing and line information in main memory. Flash Memory. Between DRAM and magnetic disk storage, another form of memory, flash memory , is becoming common, particularly because it is nonvolatile. 2Volatile memory typically loses its contents in case of a power outage, whereas nonvolatile memory does not.1The authors appreciate the valuable input of Dan Forsyth regarding the current status of storage systems in enterprises.\n",

      "Flash memories come in two types called NAND and NOR flash based on the type of logic circuits used. The NAND flash devices have a higher storage capacity for a given cost and are used as the data storage medium in appliances with capacities ranging from 8 GB to 64 GB for the popular cards that cost less than a dollar per GB.

The version of compact and digital video disks called CD-R (compact disk recordable) and DVD-R or DVD +R, which are also known as WORM (write-once-read-many) disks, are a form of optical storage used for archiving data; they allow data to be written once and read any number of times without the possibility of erasing.\n",

However, it is anticipated that magnetic disks will continue to be the primary medium of choice for large data-bases for years to come. Hence, it is important to study and understand the proper-ties and characteristics of magnetic disks and the way data files can be organized on disk in order to design effective databases with acceptable performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Magnetic tapes are frequently used as a storage medium for backing up databases because storage on tape costs much less than storage on disk. With some interven-tion by an operator—or an automatic loading device—tapes or optical removable disks must be loaded and read before the data becomes available for processing. In contrast, disks are online  devices that can be accessed directly at any time. The techniques used to store large amounts of structured data on disk are impor- tant for database designers, the DBA, and implementers of a DBMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Database designers and the DBA must know the advantages and disadvantages of each stor-age technique when they design, implement, and operate a database on a specific DBMS. Usually, the DBMS has several options available for organizing the data. The process of physical database design  involves choosing the particular data organization techniques that best suit the given application requirements from among the options. DBMS system implementers must study data organization techniques so that they can implement them efficiently and thus provide the DBA and users of the DBMS with sufficient options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typical database applications need only a small portion of the database at a time for processing. Whenever a certain portion of the data is needed, it must be located on disk, copied to main memory for processing, and then rewritten to the disk if the data is changed. The data stored on disk is organized as files  of records . Each record is a collection of data values that can be interpreted as facts about entities, their attributes, and their relationships. Records should be stored on disk in a manner that makes it possible to locate them efficiently when they are needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will dis-cuss some of the techniques for making disk access more efficient in Section 17.2.2. There are several primary file organizations , which determine how the file records are physically placed  on the disk, and hence how the records can be accessed. A heap file  (or unordered file ) places the records on disk in no particular order by appending new records at the end of the file, whereas a sorted file  (or sequential file) keeps the records ordered by the value of a particular field (called the sort key ).\n",
      "\n",
      "A hashed file  uses a hash function applied to a particular field (called the hash key ) to determine a record’s placement on disk. Other primary file organizations, such as B-trees,  use tree structures. We discuss primary file organizations in Sec- tions 16.6 through 16.9. A secondary organization  or auxiliary access structure allows efficient access to file records based on alternate fields  than those that have been used for the primary file organization. Most of these exist as indexes and will be discussed in Chapter 17.\n",

      "16.2.1 Hardware Description of Disk Devices Magnetic disks are used for storing large amounts of data. The device that holds the disks is referred to as a hard disk drive , or HDD . The most basic unit of data on the disk is a single bit of information. By magnetizing an area on a disk in certain ways, one can make that area represent a bit value of either 0 (zero) or 1 (one). To code information, bits are grouped into bytes  (or characters ).\n",
      "\n",
      "Byte sizes are typically 4 to 8 bits, depending on the computer and the device; 8 bits is the most common. We assume that one character is stored in a single byte, and we use the terms byte and character  interchangeably. The capacity  of a disk is the number of bytes it can store, which is usually very large. Small floppy disks were used with laptops and desk-tops for many years—they contained a single disk typically holding from 400 KB to 1.5 MB; they are almost completely out of circulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hard disks for personal computers currently hold from several hundred gigabytes up to a few terabytes; and large disk packs used with servers and mainframes have capacities of hundreds of gigabytes. Disk capacities continue to grow as technology improves. Whatever their capacity, all disks are made of magnetic material shaped as a thin circular disk, as shown in Figure 16.1(a), and protected by a plastic or acrylic cover.\n",

      "A disk is single-sided  if it stores information on one of its surfaces only and double- sided  if both surfaces are used. To increase storage capacity, disks are assembled into a disk pack , as shown in Figure 16.1(b), which may include many disks and therefore many surfaces. The two most common form factors are 3.5 and 2.5 inch diameter. Information is stored on a disk surface in concentric circles of small width, 5 each having a distinct diameter. Each circle is called a track .\n",
      "\n",
      "In disk packs, tracks with the same diameter on the various surfaces are called a cylinder  because of the shape they would form if connected in space. The concept of a cylinder is important because data stored on one cylinder can be retrieved much faster than if it were distributed among different cylinders. The number of tracks on a disk ranges from a few thousand to 152,000 on the disk drives shown in Table 16.2, and the capacity of each track typically ranges from tens of kilobytes to 150 Kbytes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because a track usually contains a large amount of infor-mation, it is divided into smaller blocks or sectors. The division of a track into  sectors  is hard-coded on the disk surface and cannot be changed. One type of  sector organization, as shown in Figure 16.2(a), calls a portion of a track that subtends a fixed angle at the center a sector.\n",

Sometimes several contiguous blocks, called a cluster , may be transferred as a unit. In this case, the buffer size is adjusted to match the number of bytes in the cluster. The actual hardware mechanism that reads or writes a block is the disk read/write head , which is part of a system called a disk drive .\n",

However, the cost of the additional read/write heads is high, so fixed-head disks are not commonly used. Interfacing Disk Drives to Computer Systems.\n",

      "A disk controller , typically embedded in the disk drive, controls the disk drive and interfaces it to the computer system. One of the standard interfaces used for disk drives on PCs and workstations was called SCSI  (small computer system interface). Today to connect HDDs, CDs, and DVDs to a computer, the interface of choice is SATA. SATA  stands for serial ATA, wherein ATA represents attachment; so SATA becomes serial AT attachment.\n",

The AT referred to advanced technology but is not used in the expansion of SATA due to trademark issues. Another popular interface used today is called SAS (serial attached SCSI). SATA was introduced in 2002 and allows the disk controller to be in the disk drive; only a simple circuit is required on the motherboard.\n",

      "SATA transfer speeds underwent an evolution from 2002 to 2008, going from 1.5 Gbps (gigabits per second) to 6 Gbps. SATA is now called NL-SAS for nearline SAS. The largest 3.5-inch SATA and SAS drives are 8TB, whereas 2.5-inch SAS drives are smaller and go up to 1.2TB.\n",

In terms of IOPs (input/output operations) per second as a price to performance index, SAS is considered superior to SATA. The controller accepts high-level I/O commands and takes appropriate action to position the arm and causes the read/write action to take place.\n",

The time required to do this is called the seek time . Typical seek times are 5 to 10 msec on desktops and 3 to 8 msec on servers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following that, there is another delay—called the rotational delay  or latency —while the beginning of the desired block rotates into position under the read/write head. It depends on the rpm of the disk. For example, at 15,000 rpm, the time per rotation is 4 msec and the average rotational delay is the time per half revolution, or 2 msec. At 10,000 rpm the average rotational delay increases to 3 msec.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, some additional time is needed to transfer the data; this is called the block transfer time . Hence, the total time needed to locate and transfer an arbitrary block, given its address, is the sum of the seek time, rotational delay, and block transfer time. The seek time and rotational delay are usually much larger than the block transfer time. To make the transfer of multiple blocks more efficient, it is common to transfer several consecu-tive blocks on the same track or cylinder.\n",
      "\n",
      "This eliminates the seek time and rota-tional delay for all but the first block and can result in a substantial saving of time when numerous contiguous blocks are transferred. Usually, the disk manufacturer provides a bulk transfer rate  for calculating the time required to transfer consecu- tive blocks. Appendix B contains a discussion of these and other disk parameters. The time needed to locate and transfer a disk block is in the order of milliseconds, usually ranging from 9 to 60 msec.\n",

Hence, locating data on disk is a major bottleneck in database applications.\n",

      "16.2.2 Making Data Access More Efficient on Disk In this subsection, we list some of the commonly used techniques to make accessing data more efficient on HDDs. 1. Buffering of data:  In order to deal with the incompatibility of speeds between a CPU and the electromechanical device such as an HDD, which is inherently slower, buffering of data is done in memory so that new data can be held in a buffer while old data is processed by an application.\n",
      "\n",
      "We discuss the double buffering strategy followed by general issues of buffer manage-ment and buffer replacement strategies in Section 16.3. 2. Proper organization of data on disk:  Given the structure and organization of data on disk, it is advantageous to keep related data on contiguous blocks; when multiple cylinders are needed by a relation, contiguous cylinders should be used. Doing so avoids unnecessary movement of the read/write arm and related seek times. 16.2 Secondary Storage Devices  553 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reading data ahead of request:  To minimize seek times, whenever a block is read into the buffer, blocks from the rest of the track can also be read even though they may not have been requested yet. This works well for applica-tions that are likely to need consecutive blocks; for random block reads this strategy is counterproductive. 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proper scheduling of I/O requests:  If it is necessary to read several blocks from disk, total access time can be minimized by scheduling them so that the arm moves only in one direction and picks up the blocks along its move-ment. One popular algorithm is called the elevator algorithm; this algorithm mimics the behavior of an elevator that schedules requests on multiple floors in a proper sequence. In this way, the arm can service requests along its out-ward and inward movements without much disruption. 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use of log disks to temporarily hold writes:  A single disk may be assigned to just one function called logging of writes. All blocks to be written can go to that disk sequentially, thus eliminating any seek time. This works much faster than doing the writes to a file at random locations, which requires a seek for each write. The log disk can order these writes in (cylinder, track) ordering to minimize arm movement when writing. Actually, the log disk can only be an area (extent) of a disk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having the data file and the log file on the same disk is a cheaper solution but compromises performance. Although the idea of a log disk can improve write performance, it is not feasible for most real-life application data. 6. Use of SSDs or flash memory for recovery purposes:  In applications where updates occur with high frequency, updates can be lost from main memory if the system crashes. A preventive measure would be to increase the speed of updates/writes to disk.\n",
      "\n",
      "One possible approach involves writing the updates to a nonvolatile SSD buffer, which may be a flash memory or battery-operated DRAM, both of which operate at must faster speeds (see Table 16.1). The disk controller then updates the data file during its idle time and also when the buffer becomes full. During recovery from a crash, unwritten SSD buffers must be written to the data file on HDD. For further discussion of recovery and logs, consult Chapter 22.\n",

      "\n",
      "Because there are no moving parts, the unit is more rugged, runs silently, is faster in terms of access time and provides higher transfer rates than HDD. As opposed to HDDs, where related data from the same relation must be placed on contiguous blocks, preferably on contiguous cylinders, there is no restriction on placement of data on an SSD since any address is directly addressable. As a result, the data is less likely to be fragmented; hence no reorganization is needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typi-cally, when a write to disk occurs on an HDD, the same block is overwritten with new data. In SDDs, the data is written to different NAND cells to attain wear-leveling , which prolongs the life of the SSD.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main issue preventing a wide-scale adop-tion of SSDs today is their prohibitive cost (see Table 16.1), which tends to be about 70 to 80 cents per GB as opposed to about 15 to 20 cents per GB for HDDs. In addition to flash memory, DRAM-based SSDs are also available.\n",

      "They are cost- lier than flash memory, but they offer faster access times of around 10 μs (microsec-onds) as opposed to 100 μs for flash.

      "Data records on tape are also stored in blocks—although the blocks may be substantially larger than those for disks, and interblock gaps are also quite large. With typical tape densities of 1,600 to 6,250 bytes per inch, a typical interblock gap 8 of 0.6 inch corresponds to 960 to 3,750 bytes of wasted storage space. It is customary to group many records together in one block for better space utilization.\n",

      "The main characteristic of a tape is its requirement that we access the data blocks in sequential order . To get to a block in the middle of a reel of tape, the tape is mounted and then scanned until the required block gets under the read/write head. For this reason, tape access can be slow and tapes are not used to store online data, except for some specialized applications. However, tapes serve a very important function—backing up  the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "One reason for backup is to keep copies of disk files in case the data is lost due to a disk crash, which can happen if the disk read/write head touches the disk surface because of mechanical malfunction. For this reason, disk files are copied periodically to tape. For many online critical applications, such as airline reservation systems, to avoid any downtime, mirrored systems are used to keep three sets of identical disks—two in online operation and one as backup. Here, offline disks become a backup device.\n",

While one buffer is being read or written, the CPU can pro-cess data in the other buffer because an independent disk I/O processor (controller) exists that, once started, can proceed to transfer a data block between memory and disk independent of and in parallel to CPU processing. Figure 16.3 illustrates how two processes can proceed in parallel.\n",

Double buffering permits continuous reading or writing of data on consecutive disk blocks, which eliminates the seek time and rotational delay for all but the first block transfer. Moreover, data is kept ready for processing, thus reducing the waiting time in the programs.\n",

For most large database files containing millions of pages, it is not possible to bring all of the data into main memory at the same time. We alluded to double buffering as a technique whereby we can gain efficiency in terms of performing the I/O operation between the disk and main memory into one buffer area concurrently with processing the data from another buffer. The actual management of buffers and decisions about what buffers to use to place a newly read page in the buffer is a more complex process.\n",

The buffer man-ager views the available main memory storage as a buffer pool , which has a collec- tion of pages. The size of the shared buffer pool is typically a parameter for the DBMS controlled by DBAs.\n",

      "9We use the terms page and block interchangeably in the current context.558 Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures There are two kinds of buffer managers; the first kind controls the main memory directly, as in most RDBMSs. The second kind allocates buffers in virtual memory, which allows the control to transfer to the operating system (OS). The OS in turn con-trols which buffers are actually in main memory and which ones are on disk under the control of OS.\n",
      "\n",
      "This second kind of buffer manager is common in main memory data-base systems and some object-oriented DBMSs. The overall goal of the buffer manager is twofold: (1) to maximize the probability that the requested page is found in main memory, and (2) in case of reading a new disk block from disk, to find a page to replace that will cause the least harm in the sense that it will not be required shortly again. To enable its operation, the buffer manager keeps two types of information on hand about each page in the buffer pool: 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "A pin-count : the number of times that page has been requested, or the num- ber of current users of that page. If this count falls to zero, the page is consid-ered unpinned . Initially the pin-count for every page is set to zero. Incrementing the pin-count is called pinning . In general, a pinned block should not be allowed to be written to disk. 2. A dirty bit , which is initially set to zero for all pages but is set to 1 whenever that page is updated by any application program.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of storage management, the buffer manager has the following responsibil- ity: It must make sure that the number of buffers fits in main memory. If the requested amount of data exceeds available buffer space, the buffer manager must select what buffers must be emptied, as governed by the buffer replacement policy in force. If the buffer manager allocates space in virtual memory and all buffers in use exceed the actual main memory, then the common operating system problem of “thrashing” happens and pages get moved back and forth into the swap space on disk without performing useful work.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a certain page is requested, the buffer manager takes following actions: it checks if the requested page is already in a buffer in the buffer pool; if so, it incre-ments its pin-count and releases the page. If the page is not in the buffer pool, the buffer manager does the following: a. It chooses a page for replacement, using the replacement policy, and incre-ments its pin-count. b. If the dirty bit of the replacement page is on, the buffer manager writes that page to disk by replacing its old copy on disk.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the dirty bit is not on, this page is not modified and the buffer manager is not required to write it back to disk. c. It reads the requested page into the space just freed up. d. The main memory address of the new page is passed to the requesting application. If there is no unpinned page available in the buffer pool and the requested page is not available in the buffer pool, the buffer manager may have to wait until a page gets released. A transaction requesting this page may go into a wait state or may even be aborted.\n",

      "16.3.2 Buffer Replacement Strategies: The following are some popular replacement strategies that are similar to those used elsewhere, such as in operating systems: 1. Least recently used (LRU): The strategy here is to throw out that page that has not been used (read or written) for the longest time. This requires the buffer manager to maintain a table where it records the time every time a page in a buffer is accessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas this constitutes an overhead, the strat-egy works well because for a buffer that is not used for a long time, its chance of being accessed again is small. 2. Clock policy: This is a round-robin variant of the LRU policy. Imagine the buffers are arranged like a circle similar to a clock. Each buffer has a flag with a 0 or 1 value. Buffers with a 0 are vulnerable and may be used for replacement and their contents read back to disk. Buffers with a 1 are not vulnerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a block is read into a buffer, the flag is set to 1. When the buffer is accessed, the flag is set to 1 also. The clock hand is positioned on a “current buffer.” When the buffer manager needs a buffer for a new block, it rotates the hand until it finds a buffer with a 0 and uses that to read and place the new block. (If the dirty bit is on for the page being replaced, that page will be written to disk, thus overwriting the old page at its address on disk.)\n",
      "\n",
      "If the clock hand passes buffers with 1s, it sets them to a zero. Thus, a block is replaced from its buffer only if it is not accessed until the hand com-pletes a rotation and returns to it and finds the block with the 0 that it set the last time. 3. First-in-first-out (FIFO): Under this policy, when a buffer is required, the one that has been occupied the longest by a page is used for replacement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under this policy, the manager notes the time each page gets loaded into a buffer; but it does not have to keep track of the time pages are accessed. Although FIFO needs less maintenance than LRU, it can work counter to desirable behavior. A block that remains in the buffer for a long time because it is needed continuously, such as a root block of an index, may be thrown out but may be immediately required to be brought back.\n",
      "\n",
      "LRU and clock policies are not the best policies for database applications if they require sequential scans of data and the file cannot fit into the buffer at one time. There are also situations when certain pages in buffers cannot be thrown out and written out to disk because certain other pinned pages point to those pages. Also, policies like FIFO can be modified to make sure that pinned blocks, such as root block of an index, are allowed to remain in the buffer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Modification of the clock policy also exists where important buffers can be set to higher values than 1 and therefore will not be subjected to replacement for several rotations of the hand. There are also situations when the DBMS has the ability to write certain blocks to disk even when the space occupied by those blocks is not needed. This is called force-writing  and occurs typically when log records have to be written to disk ahead of the modified pages in a transaction for recovery purposes. (See Chapter 22.)\n",
      "\n",

In this section, we define the concepts of records, record types, and files. Then we discuss techniques for placing file records on disk. Note that henceforth in this chapter we will be referring to the random access persistent secondary storage as “disk drive” or “disk.” The disk may be in different forms; for example, magnetic disks with rota-tional memory or solid-state disks with electronic access and no mechanical delays.\n",

      "16.4.1 Records and Record Types Data is usually stored in the form of records . Each record consists of a collection of related data values  or items , where each value is formed of one or more bytes and corresponds to a particular field  of the record. Records usually describe entities and their attributes. For example, an EMPLOYEE  record represents an employee entity, and each field value in the record specifies some attribute of that employee, such as Name , Birth_date , Salary , or Supervisor .\n",
      "\n",
      "A collection of field names and their corre- sponding data types constitutes a record type  or record format  definition. A data type , associated with each field, specifies the types of values a field can take. The data type of a field is usually one of the standard data types used in program- ming. These include numeric (integer, long integer, or floating point), string of characters (fixed-length or varying), Boolean (having 0 and 1 or TRUE  and FALSE values only), and sometimes specially coded date  and time  data types.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of bytes required for each data type is fixed for a given computer system. An integer may require 4 bytes, a long integer 8 bytes, a real number 4 bytes, a Boolean 1 byte, a date 10 bytes (assuming a format of YYYY-MM-DD), and a fixed-length string of k characters k bytes. Variable-length strings may require as many bytes as there are characters in each field value.\n",

      "For example, an EMPLOYEE  record type may be defined—using the C programming language notation—as the following structure: struct employee{ char name[30]; char ssn[9]; int salary; int job_code; char department[20];} ; In some database applications, the need may arise for storing data items that consist of large unstructured objects, which represent images, digitized video or audio streams, or free text. These are referred to as BLOB s (binary large objects).\n",

If every record in the file has exactly the same size (in bytes), the file is said to be made up of fixed-length records . If different records in the file have dif- ferent sizes, the file is said to be made up of variable-length records .\n",

      "A file may have variable-length records for several reasons: ■The file records are of the same record type, but one or more of the fields are of varying size ( variable-length fields ). For example, the Name  field of EMPLOYEE  can be a variable-length field. ■The file records are of the same record type, but one or more of the fields may have multiple values for individual records; such a field is called a repeating field  and a group of values for the field is often called a repeating group .\n",
      "\n",
      "■The file records are of the same record type, but one or more of the fields are optional ; that is, they may have values for some but not all of the file records (optional fields ). ■The file contains records of different record types  and hence of varying size (mixed file ).

Every record has the same fields, and field lengths are fixed, so the system can iden- tify the starting byte position of each field relative to the starting position of the record. This facilitates locating field values by programs that access such files. Notice that it is possible to represent a file that logically should have variable-length records as a fixed-length records file.\n",

      "For example, in the case of optional fields, we could have every field  included in every file record  but store a special NULL  value if no value exists for that field. For a repeating field, we could allocate as many spaces in each record as the maximum possible number of occurrences  of the field. In either case, space is wasted when certain records do not have values for all the physical spaces provided in each record. Now we consider other options for formatting records of a file of variable-length records.\n",

      "16.4.4 Allocating File Blocks on Disk There are several standard techniques for allocating the blocks of a file on disk. In contiguous allocation , the file blocks are allocated to consecutive disk blocks. This makes reading the whole file very fast using double buffering, but it makes expand ing the file difficult. In linked allocation , each file block contains a pointer to the next file block. This makes it easy to expand the file but makes it slow to read the whole file. A combination of the two allocates clusters  of consecutive disk blocks, and the clusters are linked.\n",

The header includes information to determine the disk addresses of the file blocks as well as to record format descrip- tions, which may include field lengths and the order of fields within a record for fixed-length unspanned records and field type codes, separator characters, and record type codes for variable-length records. To search for a record on disk, one or more blocks are copied into main memory buffers.\n",

      "Programs then search for the desired record or records within the buffers, using the information in the file header. If the address of the block that contains the desired record is not known, the search programs must do a linear search  through the file blocks. Each file block is copied into a buffer and searched until the record is located or all the file blocks have been searched unsuccessfully. This can be very time-consuming for a large file.\n",

      "16.5 Operations on Files   Operations on files are usually grouped into retrieval operations  and update operations . The former do not change any data in the file, but only locate certain records so that their field values can be examined and processed. The latter change the file by insertion or deletion of records or by modification of field values. In either case, we may have to select  one or more records for retrieval, deletion, or modification based on a selection condition  (or filtering condition ), which specifies criteria that the desired record or records must satisfy.\n",
      "\n",
      "16.5 Operations on Files  565 Consider an EMPLOYEE  file with fields Name , Ssn, Salary , Job_code , and Department . A simple selection condition  may involve an equality comparison on some field value—for example, ( Ssn = ‘123456789’) or ( Department  = ‘Research’). More com- plex conditions can involve other types of comparison operators, such as > or ≥ ; an example is ( Salary  ≥ 30000).\n",
      "\n",
      "The general case is to have an arbitrary Boolean expres- sion on the fields of the file as the selection condition. Search operations on files are generally based on simple selection conditions. A complex condition must be decomposed by the DBMS (or the programmer) to extract a simple condition that can be used to locate the records on disk. Each located record is then checked to determine whether it satisfies the full selection condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we may extract the simple condition ( Department  = ‘Research’) from the complex condition (( Salary  ≥ 30000) AND  (Department  = ‘Research’)); each record satisfying ( Department  = ‘Research’) is located and then tested to see if it also satisfies ( Salary  ≥ 30000). When several file records satisfy a search condition, the first record—with respect to the physical sequence of file records—is initially located and designated the current record .\n",
      "\n",
      "Subsequent search operations commence from this record and locate the next  record in the file that satisfies the condition. Actual operations for locating and accessing file records vary from system to sys- tem. In the following list, we present a set of representative operations.

Transfers the block containing that record into a main memory buffer (if it is not already there). The file pointer points to the record in the buffer and it becomes the current record.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, different verbs are used to indicate whether the located record is to be retrieved or updated. ■Read (or Get). Copies the current record from the buffer to a program vari- able in the user program. This command may also advance the current record pointer to the next record in the file, which may necessitate reading the next file block from disk. ■FindNext. Searches for the next record in the file that satisfies the search condition. Transfers the block containing that record into a main memory buffer (if it is not already there).\n",

      "The record is located in the buffer and becomes the current record.

      "The preceding (except for Open and Close) are called record-at-a-time  operations because each operation applies to a single record. It is possible to streamline the operations Find, FindNext, and Read into a single operation, Scan, whose descrip- tion is as follows: ■Scan. If the file has just been opened or reset, Scan  returns the first record; otherwise it returns the next record.

      "A file organization  refers to the organization of the data of a file into records, blocks, and access structures; this includes the way records and blocks are placed on the storage medium and interlinked. An access method , on the other hand, provides a group of operations—such as those listed earlier—that can be applied to a file. In general, it is possible to apply several access methods to a file organized using a certain organization. Some access methods, though, can be applied only to files organized in certain ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we cannot apply an indexed access method to a file without an index (see Chapter 17). Usually, we expect to use some search conditions more than others. Some files may be static , meaning that update operations are rarely performed; other, more dynamic  files may change frequently, so update operations are constantly applied to them. If a file is not updatable by the end user, it is regarded as a read-only file.\n",
      "\n",
      "16.6 Files of Unordered Records (Heap Files)  567 Most data warehouses (see Chapter 29) predominantly contain read-only files. A successful file organization should perform as efficiently as possible the operations we expect to apply frequently  to the file. For example, consider the EMPLOYEE  file, as shown in Figure 16.5(a), which stores the records for current employees in a company.\n",
      "\n",
      "We expect to insert records (when employees are hired), delete records (when employees leave the company), and modify records (for example, when an employee’s salary or job is changed). Deleting or modifying a record requires a selection condition to identify a particular record or set of records. Retrieving one or more records also requires a selection condition. If users expect mainly to apply a search condition based on Ssn, the designer must choose a file organization that facilitates locating a record given its Ssn value.\n",
      "\n",
      "This may involve physically ordering the records by Ssn value or defining an index on Ssn (see Chapter 17). Suppose that a second application uses the file to generate employees’ paychecks and requires that paychecks are grouped by department. For this application, it is best to order employee records by department and then by name within each department. The clustering of records into blocks and the orga-nization of blocks on cylinders would now be different than before. However, this arrangement conflicts with ordering the records by Ssn values.\n",
      "\n",
      "If both applications are important, the designer should choose an organization that allows both opera- tions to be done efficiently. Unfortunately, in many cases a single organization does not allow all needed operations on a file to be implemented efficiently. Since a file can be stored only once using one particular organization, the DBAs are often faced with making a difficult design choice about the file organization. They make it based on the expected importance and mix of retrieval and update operations. In the following sections and in Chapter 17, we discuss methods for organizing records of a file on disk.\n",
      "\n",

      "16.6 Files of Unordered Records (Heap Files)   In this simplest and most basic type of organization, records are placed in the file in the order in which they are inserted, so new records are inserted at the end of the file. Such an organization is called a heap  or pile file . 11 This organization is often used with additional access paths, such as the secondary indexes discussed in Chap-ter 17. It is also used to collect and store data records for future use. Inserting a new record is very efficient.\n",

      "The last disk block of the file is copied into a buffer, the new record is added, and the block is then rewritten  back to disk. The address of the last file block is kept in the file header.

      "\n",
      "If only one record satisfies the search condition, then, on the average, a program will read into memory and search half the file 11Sometimes this organization is called a sequential file .568 Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures blocks before it finds the record. For a file of b blocks, this requires searching ( b/2) blocks, on average. If no records or several records satisfy the search condition, the program must read and search all b blocks in the file.\n",
      "\n",
      "To delete a record, a program must first find its block, copy the block into a buffer, delete the record from the buffer, and finally rewrite the block  back to the disk. This leaves unused space in the disk block. Deleting a large number of records in this way results in wasted storage space. Another technique used for record deletion is to have an extra byte or bit, called a deletion marker , stored with each record. A record is deleted by setting the deletion marker to a certain value. A different value for the marker indicates a valid (not deleted) record.\n",
      "\n",
      "Search programs consider only valid records in a block when conducting their search. Both of these deletion techniques require periodic reorganization  of the file to reclaim the unused space of deleted records. During reorganization, the file blocks are accessed consecu-tively, and records are packed by removing deleted records. After such a reorgani-zation, the blocks are filled to capacity once more. Another possibility is to use the space of deleted records when inserting new records, although this requires extra bookkeeping to keep track of empty locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can use either spanned or unspanned organization for an unordered file, and it may be used with either fixed-length or variable-length records. Modifying a vari-able-length record may require deleting the old record and inserting a modified record because the modified record may not fit in its old space on disk. To read all records in order of the values of some field, we create a sorted copy of the file. Sorting is an expensive operation for a large disk file, and special techniques for external sorting  are used (see Chapter 18).\n",

For record deletion, the prob-lem is less severe if deletion markers and periodic reorganization are used. One option for making insertion more efficient is to keep some unused space in each block for new records. However, once this space is used up, the original problem resurfaces.\n",

Periodically, the overflow file is sorted and merged with the master file during file reorganization. Insertion becomes very efficient, but at the cost of increased complexity in the search algo-rithm.\n",

For applications that do not require the most up-to-date information, overflow records can be ignored during a search.

Simulation and analysis studies have shown that it is usu-ally best to keep a hash file between 70 and 90% full so that the number of collisions remains low and we do not waste too much space. Hence, if we expect to have r records to store in the table, we should choose M locations for the address space such that ( r/M) is between 0.7 and 0.9.\n",

      "16.8.2 External Hashing for Disk Files Hashing for disk files is called external hashing . To suit the characteristics of disk storage, the target address space is made of buckets , each of which holds multiple records. A bucket is either one disk block or a cluster of contiguous disk blocks. The hashing function maps a key into a relative bucket number rather than assigning an absolute block address to the bucket. A table maintained in the file header converts the bucket number into the corresponding disk block address, as illustrated in Figure 16.9.\n",
      "\n",
      "The collision problem is less severe with buckets, because as many records as will fit in a bucket can hash to the same bucket without causing problems. However, we must make provisions for the case where a bucket is filled to capacity and a new record being inserted hashes to that bucket. We can use a variation of chaining in which a pointer is maintained in each bucket to a linked list of overflow records for the bucket, as shown in Figure 16.10. The pointers in the linked list should be record pointers , which include both a block address and a relative record position within the block.\n",

Although most good hash functions do not maintain records in order of hash field values, some functions—called order preserving — do. A simple example of an order-preserving hash function is to take the leftmost three digits of an invoice number field that yields a bucket address as the hash address and keep the records sorted by invoice number within each bucket.\n",

      "Another example is to use an integer hash key directly as an index to a relative file, if the hash key values fill up a particular interval; for example, if employee numbers in a com-pany are assigned as 1, 2, 3, … up to the total number of employees, we can use the identity hash function (i.e., Relative Address = Key) that maintains order. Unfortu-nately, this only works if sequence keys are generated in order by some application.\n",

      "The hashing scheme described so far is called static hashing  because a fixed num- ber of buckets M is allocated. The function does key-to-address mapping, whereby we are fixing the address space. This can be a serious drawback for dynamic files. Suppose that we allocate M buckets for the address space and let m be the maxi- mum number of records that can fit in one bucket; then at most ( m * M) records will fit in the allocated space.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the number of records turns out to be substantially fewer than ( m * M), we are left with a lot of unused space. On the other hand, if the number of records increases to substantially more than ( m * M), numerous colli- sions will result and retrieval will be slowed down because of the long lists of over-flow records. In either case, we may have to change the number of blocks M allocated and then use a new hashing function (based on the new value of M) to redistribute the records.\n",

      "These reorganizations can be quite time-consuming for large files. Newer dynamic file organizations based on hashing allow the number of buckets to vary dynamically with only localized reorganization (see Section 16.8.3). When using external hashing, searching for a record given a value of some field other than the hash field is as expensive as in the case of an unordered file. Record deletion can be implemented by removing the record from its bucket. If the bucket has an overflow chain, we can move one of the overflow records into the bucket to replace the deleted record.\n",

      "If the record to be deleted is already in overflow, we sim-ply remove it from the linked list. Notice that removing an overflow record implies that we should keep track of empty positions in overflow. This is done easily by maintaining a linked list of unused overflow locations.

      "The first 578 Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures scheme—extendible hashing—stores an access structure in addition to the file, and hence is somewhat similar to indexing (see Chapter 17). The main difference is that the access structure is based on the values that result after application of the hash function to the search field. In indexing, the access structure is based on the values of the search field itself. The second technique, called linear hashing, does not require additional access structures.\n",

      "Another scheme, called dynamic hashing , uses an access structure based on binary tree data structures. These hashing schemes take advantage of the fact that the result of applying a hash- ing function is a nonnegative integer and hence can be represented as a binary number. The access structure is built on the binary representation  of the hashing function result, which is a string of bits. We call this the hash value  of a record. Records are distributed among buckets based on the values of the leading bits  in their hash values. Extendible Hashing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In extendible hashing, proposed by Fagin (1979), a type of directory—an array of 2 d bucket addresses—is maintained, where d is called the global depth  of the directory. The integer value corresponding to the first (high- order) d bits of a hash value is used as an index to the array to determine a directory entry, and the address in that entry determines the bucket in which the correspond- ing records are stored. However, there does not have to be a distinct bucket for each of the 2d directory locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several directory locations with the same first d′ bits for their hash values may contain the same bucket address if all the records that hash to these locations fit in a single bucket. A local depth  d′—stored with each bucket—specifies the number of bits on which the bucket contents are based. Fig- ure 16.11 shows a directory with global depth d = 3. The value of d can be increased or decreased by one at a time, thus doubling or halving the number of entries in the directory array.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doubling is needed if a bucket, whose local depth d′ is equal to the global depth d, overflows. Halving occurs if d > d′ for all the buckets after some deletions occur. Most record retrievals require two block accesses—one to the directory and the other to the bucket. To illustrate bucket splitting, suppose that a new inserted record causes overflow in the bucket whose hash values start with 01—the third bucket in Figure 16.11.\n",
      "\n",
      "The records will be distributed between two buckets: the first contains all records whose hash values start with 010, and the second all those whose hash values start with 011. Now the two directory locations for 010 and 011 point to the two new distinct buckets. Before the split, they pointed to the same bucket. The local depth d′ of the two new buckets is 3, which is one more than the local depth of the old bucket.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a bucket that overflows and is split used to have a local depth d′ equal to the global depth d of the directory, then the size of the directory must now be doubled so that we can use an extra bit to distinguish the two new buckets.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if the bucket for records whose hash values start with 111 in Figure 16.11 overflows, the two new buckets need a directory with global depth d = 4, because the two buckets are now labeled 1110 and 1111, and hence their local depths are both 4.\n",

      "The space overhead for the directory table is negligible. The maximum directory size is 2k, where k is the number of bits in the hash value. Another advantage is that splitting causes minor reorganization in most cases, since only the records in one bucket are redistributed to the two new buckets. The only time reorganization is more expensive is when the directory has to be doubled (or halved). A disadvantage is that the directory must be searched before accessing the buckets themselves, resulting in two block accesses instead of one in static hashing.\n",

      "This performance penalty is considered minor and thus the scheme is considered quite desirable for dynamic files. Dynamic Hashing. A precursor to extendible hashing was dynamic hashing pro- posed by Larson (1978), in which the addresses of the buckets were either the n high-order bits or n − 1 high-order bits, depending on the total number of keys belonging to the respective bucket. The eventual storage of records in buckets for dynamic hashing is somewhat similar to extendible hashing. The major difference is in the organization of the directory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas extendible hashing uses the notion of global depth (high-order d bits) for the flat directory and then combines adjacent collapsible buckets into a bucket of local depth d − 1, dynamic hashing maintains a tree-structured directory with two types of nodes: ■Internal nodes that have two pointers—the left pointer corresponding to the 0 bit (in the hashed address) and a right pointer corresponding to the 1 bit. ■Leaf nodes—these hold a pointer to the actual bucket with records.\n",

Four buckets are shown (“000”, “001”, “110”, and “111”) with high-order 3-bit addresses (corre-sponding to the global depth of 3), and two buckets (“01” and “10”) are shown with high-order 2-bit addresses (corresponding to the local depth of 2).\n",

      "This is typically the first field in each record and is used by the system software to determine the type of record it is about to process. Using the catalog information, the DBMS can deter- mine the fields of that record type and their sizes, in order to interpret the data values in the record.\n",
      "\n",
      "16.9.2  B-Trees and Other Data Structures as Primary Organization Other data structures can be used for primary file organizations. For example, if both the record size and the number of records in a file are small, some DBMSs offer the option of a B-tree data structure as the primary file organization. We will describe B-trees in Section 17.3.1, when we discuss the use of the B-tree data structure for indexing.\n",

      "16.10  Parallelizing Disk Access Using   RAID Technology With the exponential growth in the performance and capacity of semiconductor devices and memories, faster microprocessors with larger and larger primary mem-ories are continually becoming available. To match this growth, it is natural to expect that secondary storage technology must also take steps to keep up with pro-cessor technology in performance and reliability. A major advance in secondary storage technology is represented by the develop- ment of RAID , which originally stood for redundant arrays of inexpensive disks .\n",
      "\n",
      "More recently, the I in RAID is said to stand for independent . The RAID idea received a very positive industry endorsement and has been developed into an elab-orate set of alternative RAID architectures (RAID levels 0 through 6). We highlight the main features of the technology in this section. The main goal of RAID is to even out the widely different rates of performance improvement of disks against those in memory and microprocessors.\n",
      "\n",
      "17 Although RAM capacities have quadrupled every two to three years, disk access times  are improving at less than 10% per year, and disk transfer rates  are improving at roughly 20% per year. Disk capacities  are indeed improving at more than 50% per year, but the speed and access time improvements are of a much smaller magnitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "A second qualitative disparity exists between the ability of special microprocessors that cater to new applications involving video, audio, image, and spatial data pro-cessing (see Chapters 26 for details of these applications), with corresponding lack of fast access to large, shared data sets. The natural solution is a large array of small independent disks acting as a single higher performance logical disk. A concept called data striping is used, which utilizes parallelism  to improve disk performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data striping  distributes data transpar- ently over multiple disks to make them appear as a single large, fast disk. Figure 16.13 shows a file distributed or striped  over four disks. In bit-level striping , a byte is split and individual bits are stored on independent disks. Figure 16.13(a) illustrates bit-striping across four disks where the bits (0, 4) are assigned to disk 0, bits (1, 5) to disk 1, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this striping, every disk participates in every read or write operation; the number of accesses per second would remain the same as on a single disk, but the amount of data read in a given time would increase fourfold. Thus, striping improves overall I/O performance by providing high overall transfer rates. Block-level striping  stripes blocks across disks. It treats the array of disks as if it is one disk. Blocks are logically numbered from 0 in sequence.\n",

      "\n",
      "Keeping a single copy of data in such an array of disks will cause a significant loss of reliability. An obvious solution is to employ redundancy of data so that disk failures can be tolerated. The disadvantages are many: additional I/O operations for write, extra computation to maintain redundancy and to do recovery from errors, and additional disk capacity to store redundant information. One technique for introducing redundancy is called mirroring  or shadowing . Data is written redundantly to two identical physical disks that are treated as one logical disk.\n",

      "\n",
      "The incorporation of redundancy must consider two problems: select-ing a technique for computing the redundant information, and selecting a method of distributing the redundant information across the disk array. The first problem is addressed by using error-correcting codes involving parity bits, or specialized codes such as Hamming codes. Under the parity scheme, a redundant disk may be consid-ered as having the sum of all the data in the other disks. When a disk fails, the miss-ing information can be constructed by a process similar to subtraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the second problem, the two major approaches are either to store the redun- dant information on a small number of disks or to distribute it uniformly across all disks. The latter results in better load balancing. The different levels of RAID choose a combination of these options to implement redundancy and improve reliability.\n",
      "\n",
      "16.10.2 Improving Performance with RAID   The disk arrays employ the technique of data striping to achieve higher transfer rates. Note that data can be read or written only one block at a time, so a typical transfer contains 512 to 8,192 bytes. Disk striping may be applied at a finer granu-larity by breaking up a byte of data into bits and spreading the bits to different disks. Thus, bit-level data striping  consists of splitting a byte of data and writing bit j to the jth disk.\n",
      "\n",
      "With 8-bit bytes, eight physical disks may be considered as one logical disk with an eightfold increase in the data transfer rate. Each disk partici- pates in each I/O request and the total amount of data read per request is eight times as much. Bit-level striping can be generalized to a number of disks that is either a multiple or a factor of eight. Thus, in a four-disk array, bit n goes to the disk which is ( n mod 4). Figure 16.13(a) shows bit-level striping of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The granularity of data interleaving can be higher than a bit; for example, blocks of a file can be striped across disks, giving rise to block-level striping . Figure 16.13(b) shows block-level data striping assuming the data file contains four blocks. With block-level striping, multiple independent requests that access single blocks (small requests) can be serviced in parallel by separate disks, thus decreasing the queuing time of I/O requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Requests that access multiple blocks (large requests) can be parallelized, thus reducing their response time. In general, the more the number of disks in an array, the larger the potential performance benefit. However, assuming independent failures, the disk array of 100 disks collectively has 1/100th the reli-ability of a single disk. Thus, redundancy via error-correcting codes and disk mir-roring is necessary to provide reliability along with high performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "16.10.3 RAID Organizations and Levels   Different RAID organizations were defined based on different combinations of the two factors of granularity of data interleaving (striping) and pattern used to com-pute redundant information. In the initial proposal, levels 1 through 5 of RAID were proposed, and two additional levels—0 and 6—were added later.\n",
      "\n",
      "16.10 Parallelizing Disk Access Using RAID Technology  587 RAID level 0 uses data striping, has no redundant data, and hence has the best write performance since updates do not have to be duplicated. It splits data evenly across two or more disks. However, its read performance is not as good as RAID level 1, which uses mirrored disks. In the latter, performance improvement is possible by scheduling a read request to the disk with shortest expected seek and rotational delay.\n",
      "\n",
      "RAID level 2 uses memory-style redundancy by using Hamming codes, which contain parity bits for distinct overlapping subsets of components. Thus, in one particular version of this level, three redundant disks suffice for four original disks, whereas with mirroring—as in level 1—four would be required. Level 2 includes both error detection and correction, although detection is generally not required because broken disks identify themselves. RAID level 3 uses a single parity disk relying on the disk controller to figure out which disk has failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Levels 4 and 5 use block-level data striping, with level 5 dis-tributing data and parity information across all disks. Figure 16.14(b) shows an illustration of RAID level 5, where parity is shown with subscript p. If one disk fails, the missing data is calculated based on the parity available from the remaining disks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, RAID level 6 applies the so-called P + Q redundancy scheme using Reed-Soloman codes to protect against up to two disk failures by using just two redundant disks. Rebuilding in case of disk failure is easiest for RAID level 1. Other levels require the reconstruction of a failed disk by reading multiple disks. Level 1 is used for critical applications such as storing logs of transactions. Levels 3 and 5 are pre-ferred for large volume storage, with level 3 providing higher transfer rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most popular use of RAID technology currently uses level 0 (with striping), level 1 (with mirroring), and level 5 with an extra drive for parity.\n",

      "In this section, we describe some recent developments in storage systems that are becoming an integral part of most enterprise’s information system architectures. We already mentioned the SATA and SAS interface, which has almost replaced the previously popular SCSI (small computer system interface) in laptops and small servers. The Fibre Channel (FC) interface is the predominant choice for storage networks in data centers. We review some of the modern storage architectures next.\n",
      "\n",
      "16.11.1 Storage Area Networks   With the rapid growth of electronic commerce, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems that integrate application data across organizations, and data warehouses that keep historical aggregate information (see Chapter 29), the demand for storage has gone up substantially. For today’s Internet-driven organizations, it has become necessary to move from a static fixed data center-oriented operation to a more flex-ible and dynamic infrastructure for the organizations’ information processing requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The total cost of managing all data is growing so rapidly that in many instances the cost of managing server-attached storage exceeds the cost of the server itself. Furthermore, the procurement cost of storage is only a small fraction—typi-cally, only 10 to 15% of the overall cost of storage management. Many users of RAID systems cannot use the capacity effectively because it has to be attached in a fixed manner to one or more servers. Therefore, most large organizations have moved to a concept called storage area networks (SANs) .\n",
      "\n",
      "In a SAN, online storage peripherals are configured as nodes on a high-speed network and can be attached and detached from servers in a very flexible manner. Several companies have emerged as SAN providers and supply their own proprie- tary topologies. They allow storage systems to be placed at longer distances from the servers and provide different performance and connectivity options. Existing storage management applications can be ported into SAN configurations using Fibre Channel networks that encapsulate the legacy SCSI protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, the SAN-attached devices appear as SCSI devices. Current architectural alternatives for SAN include the following: point-to-point connections between servers and storage systems via Fiber Channel; use of a Fiber  16.11 Modern Storage Architectures  589 Channel switch to connect multiple RAID systems, tape libraries, and so on to serv- ers; and the use of Fiber Channel hubs and switches to connect servers and storage systems in different configurations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Organizations can slowly move up from sim-pler topologies to more complex ones by adding servers and storage devices as needed. We do not provide further details here because they vary among SAN ven-dors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main advantages claimed include: ■Flexible many-to-many connectivity among servers and storage devices using Fiber Channel hubs and switches ■Up to 10 km separation between a server and a storage system using appro- priate fiber optic cables ■Better isolation capabilities allowing nondisruptive addition of new periph- erals and servers ■High-speed data replication across multiple storage systems. Typical tech- nologies use synchronous replication for local and asynchronous replication for disaster recovery (DR) solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "SANs are growing very rapidly but are still faced with many problems, such as com- bining storage options from multiple vendors and dealing with evolving standards of storage management software and hardware. Most major companies are evaluat- ing SANs as a viable option for database storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "16.11.2 Network-Attached Storage   With the phenomenal growth in digital data, particularly generated from multi-media and other enterprise applications, the need for high-performance storage solutions at low cost has become extremely important. Network-attached storage (NAS) devices are among the storage devices being used for this purpose. These devices are, in fact, servers that do not provide any of the common server services, but simply allow the addition of storage for file sharing .\n",
      "\n",
      "NAS devices allow vast amounts of hard-disk storage space to be added to a network and can make that space available to multiple servers without shutting them down for maintenance and upgrades. NAS devices can reside anywhere on a local area network (LAN) and may be combined in different configurations. A single hardware device, often called the NAS box  or NAS head , acts as the interface between the NAS system and net- work clients. These NAS devices require no monitor, keyboard, or mouse. One or more disk or tape drives can be attached to many NAS systems to increase total capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clients connect to the NAS head rather than to the individual storage devices. A NAS can store any data that appears in the form of files, such as e-mail boxes, Web content, remote system backups, and so on. In that sense, NAS devices are being deployed as a replacement for traditional file servers. NAS systems strive for reliable operation and easy administration. They include built-in features such as secure authentication, or the automatic sending of e-mail alerts in case of error on the device.\n",
      "\n",
      "The NAS devices (or appliances , as some ven- dors refer to them) are being offered with a high degree of scalability, reliability, 590 Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures flexibility, and performance. Such devices typically support RAID levels 0, 1, and 5. Traditional storage area networks (SANs) differ from NAS in several ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifi-cally, SANs often utilize Fibre Channel rather than Ethernet, and a SAN often incorporates multiple network devices or endpoints  on a self-contained or private LAN, whereas NAS relies on individual devices connected directly to the existing public LAN. Whereas Windows, UNIX, and NetWare file servers each demand specific protocol support on the client side, NAS systems claim greater operating system independence of clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, NAS provides a file system interface with support for networked files using protocols such as common internet file sys-tem (CIFS) or network file system (NFS).\n",
      "\n",
      "16.11.3 iSCSI and Other Network-Based Storage Protocols   A new protocol called iSCSI  (Internet SCSI) has been proposed recently. It is a block-storage protocol like SAN. It allows clients (called initiators ) to send SCSI commands to SCSI storage devices on remote channels. The main advantage of iSCSI is that it does not require the special cabling needed by Fibre Channel and it can run over longer distances using existing network infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "By carrying SCSI commands over IP networks, iSCSI facilitates data transfers over intranets and manages storage over long distances. It can transfer data over local area net-works (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), or the Internet. iSCSI works as follows. When a DBMS needs to access data, the operating system generates the appropriate SCSI commands and data request, which then go through encapsulation and, if necessary, encryption procedures. A packet header is added before the resulting IP packets are transmitted over an Ethernet connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a packet is received, it is decrypted (if it was encrypted before transmission) and disassembled, separating the SCSI commands and request. The SCSI commands go via the SCSI controller to the SCSI storage device. Because iSCSI is bidirectional, the protocol can also be used to return data in response to the original request. Cisco and IBM have marketed switches and routers based on this technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "iSCSI storage  has mainly impacted small- and medium-sized businesses because of its combination of simplicity, low cost, and the functionality of iSCSI devices. It allows them not to learn the ins and outs of Fibre Channel (FC) technology and instead benefit from their familiarity with the IP protocol and Ethernet hardware. iSCSI implementations in the data centers of very large enterprise businesses are slow in development due to their prior investment in Fibre Channel–based SANs.\n",
      "\n",
      "iSCSI is one of two main approaches to storage data transmission over IP networks. The other method, Fibre Channel over IP (FCIP) , translates Fibre Channel control codes and data into IP packets for transmission between geographically distant Fibre Channel storage area networks. This protocol, known also as Fibre Channel tunneling  or storage tunneling , can only be used in conjunction with Fibre Channel technology, whereas iSCSI can run over existing Ethernet networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest idea to enter the enterprise IP storage race is Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) , which can be thought of as iSCSI without the IP. It uses many  16.11 Modern Storage Architectures  591 elements of SCSI and FC (just like iSCSI), but it does not include TCP/IP compo- nents. FCoE has been successfully productized by CISCO (termed “Data Center Ethernet”) and Brocade.\n",
      "\n",
      "It takes advantage of a reliable ethernet technology that uses buffering and end-to-end flow control to avoid dropped packets. This prom-ises excellent performance, especially on 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE), and is  relatively easy for vendors to add to their products.\n",
      "\n",
      "16.11.4 Automated Storage Tiering   Another trend in storage is automated storage tiering (AST), which automati-cally moves data between different storage types such as SATA, SAS, and solid-state drives (SSDs) depending on the need. The storage administrator can set up a tiering policy in which less frequently used data is moved to slower and cheaper SATA drives and more frequently used data is moved up to solid-state drives (see Table  16.1 for the various tiers of storage ordered by increasing speed of access).\n",
      "\n",
      "This automated tiering can improve database performance tremendously. EMC has an implementation of this technology called FAST (fully automated stor- age tiering) that does continuous monitoring of data activity and takes actions to move the data to the appropriate tier based on the policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "16.11.5 Object-Based Storage   During the last few years, there have been major developments in terms of rapid growth of the cloud concept, distributed architectures for databases and for analyt-ics, and development of data-intensive applications on the Web (see Chapters 23, 24, and 25). These developments have caused fundamental changes in enterprise storage infrastructure. The hardware-oriented file-based systems are evolving into new open-ended architectures for storage. The latest among these is object-based storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under this scheme, data is managed in the form of objects rather than files made of blocks. Objects carry metadata that contains properties that can be used for managing those objects. Each object carries a unique global identifier that is used to locate it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Object storage has its origins in research projects at CMU (Gibson et al., 1996) on scaling up of network attached storage and in the Oceanstore system at UC Berkeley (Kubiatowicz et al., 2000), which attempted to build a global infra-structure over all forms of trusted and untrusted servers for continuous access to persistent data. There is no need to do lower level storage operations in terms of capacity management or making decisions like what type of RAID architecture should be used for fault protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Object storage also allows additional flexibility in terms of interfaces—it gives con- trol to applications that can control the objects directly and also allows the objects to be addressable across a wide namespace spanning multiple devices. Replication and distribution of objects is also supported. In general, object storage is ideally suited for scalable storage of massive amounts of unstructured data such as Web pages, images, and audio/video clips and files.\n",
      "\n",
      "Object-based storage device com-mands (OSDs) were proposed as part of SCSI protocol a long time ago but did not 592 Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures become a commercial product until Seagate adopted OSDs in its Kinetic Open Storage Platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, Facebook uses an object storage system to store pho-tos at the level of over 350 Petabytes of storage; Spotify uses an object storage sys-tem for storing songs; and Dropbox uses it for its storage infrastructure. Object storage is the choice of many cloud offerings, such as Amazon’s AWS (Amazon Web Service) S3, and Microsoft’s Azure, which stores files, relations, messages, and so on as objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other examples of products include Hitachi’s HCP, EMC’s Atmos, and Scality’s RING. Openstack Swift is an open source project that allows one to use HTTP GET and PUT to retrieve and store objects—that’s basically the whole API. Openstack Swift uses very cheap hardware, is fully fault resistant, automati-cally takes advantage of geographic redundancy, and scales to very large numbers of objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since object storage forces locking to occur at the object level, it is not clear how suitable it is for concurrent transaction processing in high-throughput transaction-oriented systems. Therefore, it is still not considered viable for main-stream enterprise-level database applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "16.12  Summary   We began this chapter by discussing the characteristics of memory hierarchies and then concentrated on secondary storage devices. In particular, we focused on mag-netic disks because they are still the preferred medium to store online database files. Table 16.1 presented a perspective on the memory hierarchies and their current capacities, access speeds, transfer rates, and costs. Data on disk is stored in blocks; accessing a disk block is expensive because of the seek time, rotational delay, and block transfer time.\n",
      "\n",
      "To reduce the average block access time, double buffering can be used when accessing consecutive disk blocks. (Other disk parameters are discussed in Appendix B.) We introduced the various interface technologies in use today for disk drives and optical devices. We presented a list of strategies employed to improve access of data from disks. We also intro- duced solid-state drives, which are rapidly becoming popular, and optical drives, which are mainly used as tertiary storage. We discussed the working of the buffer manager, which is responsible for handling data requests and we presented various buffer replacement policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "We presented different ways of storing file records on disk. File records are grouped into disk blocks and can be fixed length or variable length, spanned or unspanned, and of the same record type or mixed types. We dis-cussed the file header, which describes the record formats and keeps track of the disk addresses of the file blocks. Information in the file header is used by system software accessing the file records. Then we presented a set of typical commands for accessing individual file records and discussed the concept of the current record of a file.\n",
      "\n",
      "We discussed how com-plex record search conditions are transformed into simple search conditions that are used to locate records in the file. Three primary file organizations were then discussed: unordered, ordered, and hashed. Unordered files require a linear search to locate records, but record\n",
      "\n",
      "﻿17.1 Types of Single-Level Ordered Indexes   The idea behind an ordered index is similar to that behind the index used in a text-book, which lists important terms at the end of the book in alphabetical order along with a list of page numbers where the term appears in the book. We can search the book index for a certain term in the textbook to find a list of addresses— page num- bers in this case—and use these addresses to locate the specified pages first and then search  for the term on each specified page.\n",
      "\n",
      "The alternative, if no other guidance is given, would be to sift slowly through the whole textbook word by word to find the term we are interested in; this corresponds to doing a linear search , which scans the whole file. Of course, most books do have additional information, such as chapter and section titles, which help us find a term without having to search through the whole book. However, the index is the only exact indication of the pages where each term occurs in the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a file with a given record structure consisting of several fields (or attributes), an index access structure is usually defined on a single field of a file, called an indexing field  (or indexing attribute ). 1 The index typically stores each value of the index field along with a list of pointers to all disk blocks that contain records with that field value. The values in the index are ordered  so that we can do a binary search  on the index.\n",

      "If both the data file and the index file are ordered, and since the index file is typically much smaller than the data file, searching the index using a binary search is a better option. Tree-structured multilevel indexes (see Section 17.2) implement an extension of the binary search idea that reduces the search space by two-way partitioning at each search step to an n-ary partitioning approach that divides the search space in the file n-ways at each stage. There are several types of ordered indexes.\n",

      "A primary index  is specified on the ordering key field  of an ordered file  of records. Recall from Section 16.7 that an ordering key field is used to physically order  the file records on disk, and every record has a unique value  for that field. If the ordering field is not a key field—that is, if numerous records in the file can have the same value for the ordering field—another type of index, called a clustering index , can be used. The data file is called a clustered file  in this latter case.\n",

A third type of index, called a secondary index , can be specified on any nonordering  field of a file. A data file can have several secondary indexes in addition to its primary access method. We discuss these types of single-level indexes in the next three subsections.\n",
      "\n",
      "17.1.1 Primary Indexes A primary index  is an ordered file whose records are of fixed length with two fields, and it acts like an access structure to efficiently search for and access the data records in a data file. The first field is of the same data type as the ordering key field—called the primary key —of the data file, and the second field is a pointer to a disk block (a block address). There is one index entry  (or index record ) in the index file for each block  in the data file.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each index entry has the value of the primary key field for the first record in a block and a pointer to that block as its two field values. We will refer to the two field values of index entry i as <K(i), P(i)>. In the rest of this chapter, we refer to different types of index entries < K (i), X > as follows: ■X may be the physical address of a block (or page) in the file, as in the case of P(i) above.\n",
      "\n",
      "■X may be the record address made up of a block address and a record id (or offset) within the block. ■X may be a logical address of the block or of the record within the file and is a relative number that would be mapped to a physical address (see further explanation in Section 17.6.1). To create a primary index on the ordered file shown in Figure 16.7, we use the Name field as primary key, because that is the ordering key field of the file (assuming that each value of Name  is unique).\n",
      "\n",
      "Each entry in the index has a Name  value and a pointer. The first three index entries are as follows: <K(1) = (Aaron, Ed), P(1) = address of block 1> <K(2) = (Adams, John), P(2) = address of block 2> <K(3) = (Alexander, Ed), P(3) = address of block 3> Figure 17.1 illustrates this primary index.\n",
      "\n",
      "The total number of entries in the index is the same as the number of disk blocks  in the ordered data file. The first record in each block of the data file is called the anchor record  of the block, or simply the block anchor .2 Indexes can also be characterized as dense or sparse. A dense index  has an index entry for every search key value  (and hence every record) in the data file. A sparse (or nondense ) index , on the other hand, has index entries for only some of the search values.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sparse index has fewer entries than the number of records in the file. Thus, a primary index is a nondense (sparse) index, since it includes an 2We can use a scheme similar to the one described here, with the last record in each block (rather than the first) as the block anchor.\n",
      "\n",
      "This slightly improves the efficiency of the search algorithm entry for each disk block of the data file and the keys of its anchor record rather than for every search value (or every record).3 The index file for a primary index occupies a much smaller space than does the data file, for two reasons. First, there are fewer index entries  than there are records in the data file. Second, each index entry is typically smaller in size  than a data record because it has only two fields, both of which tend to be short in size; consequently, more index entries than data records can fit in one block.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, a binary search on the index file requires fewer block accesses than a binary search on the data file. Referring to Table 16.3, note that the binary search for an ordered data file required log 2b block accesses. But if the primary index file contains only bi blocks, then to locate a record with a search key value requires a binary search of that index and access to the block containing that record: a total of log 2bi + 1 accesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "A record whose primary key value is K lies in the block whose address is P(i), where K(i) ≤ K < K(i + 1). The ith block in the data file contains all such records because of the physical ordering of the file records on the primary key field. To retrieve a record, given the value K of its primary key field, we do a binary search on the index file to find the appropriate index entry i, and then retrieve the data file block whose address is P(i).\n",

      "To search for a record using the index, we need one additional block access to the data file for a total of 5 + 1 = 6 block accesses—an improvement over binary search on the data file, which required 13 disk block accesses. Note that the index with 7,500 entries of 15 bytes each is rather small (112,500 or 112.5 Kbytes) and would typically be kept in main memory thus requiring negligible time to search with binary search.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that case we simply make one block access to retrieve the record. 3The sparse primary index has been called clustered (primary) index in some books and articles. 4Notice that the above formula would not be correct if the data file were ordered on a nonkey field ; in that case the same index value in the block anchor could be repeated in the last records of the previous block.\n",

      "\n",
      "With a primary index, the problem is compounded because if we attempt to insert a record in its correct position in the data file, we must not only move records to make space for the new record but also change some index entries, since moving records will change the anchor records  of some blocks. Using an unordered overflow file, as discussed in Section 16.7, can reduce this problem. Another possibility is to use a linked list of overflow records for each block in the data file.\n",
      "\n",

      "17.1.2 Clustering Indexes If file records are physically ordered on a nonkey field—which does not  have a dis- tinct value for each record—that field is called the clustering field  and the data file is called a clustered file. We can create a different type of index, called a clustering index , to speed up retrieval of all the records that have the same value for the clus- tering field. This differs from a primary index, which requires that the ordering field of the data file have a distinct value  for each record.\n",
      "\n",
      "A clustering index is also an ordered file with two fields; the first field is of the same type as the clustering field of the data file, and the second field is a disk block pointer. There is one entry in the clustering index for each distinct value  of the clustering field, and it contains the value and a pointer to the first block  in the data file that has a record with that value for its clustering field. Figure 17.2 shows an example. Notice that record insertion and deletion still cause problems because the data records are physically ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "To alleviate the problem of insertion, it is common to reserve a whole block (or a cluster of contiguous blocks) for each value of the clustering field; all records with that value are placed in the block (or block cluster). This makes insertion and deletion relatively straightforward. Figure 17.3 shows this scheme. A clustering index is another example of a nondense  index because it has an entry for every distinct value  of the indexing field, which is a nonkey by definition and hence has duplicate values rather than a unique value for every record in the file.\n",

      "17.1.3 Secondary Indexes A secondary index  provides a secondary means of accessing a data file for which some primary access already exists. The data file records could be ordered, unor-dered, or hashed. The secondary index may be created on a field that is a candidate key and has a unique value in every record, or on a nonkey field with duplicate values. The index is again an ordered file with two fields. The first field is of the same data type as some nonordering field  of the data file that is an indexing field .\n",
      "\n",
      "The second field is either a block  pointer or a record  pointer. Many  secondary indexes (and hence, indexing fields) can be created for the same file—each repre-sents an additional means of accessing that file based on some specific field. First we consider a secondary index access structure on a key (unique) field that has a distinct value  for every record. Such a field is sometimes called a secondary  key; in the relational model, this would correspond to any UNIQUE  key attribute or to the primary key attribute of a table.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case there is one index entry for each record  in the data file, which contains the value of the field for the record and a pointer either to the block in which the record is stored or to the record itself. Hence, such an index is dense . Again we refer to the two field values of index entry i as < K(i), P(i)>. The entries are ordered  by value of K(i), so we can perform a binary search. Because the records of the data file are not physically ordered by values of the secondary key field, we cannot use block anchors.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is why an index entry is created for each record in the data file, rather than for each block, as in the case of a primary index. Figure 17.4 illustrates a secondary index in which the pointers P(i) in the index entries are block pointers, not record pointers. Once the appropriate disk block is transferred to a main memory buffer, a search for the desired record within the block can be carried out. A secondary index usually needs more storage space and longer search time than does a primary index, because of its larger number of entries.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the improve- ment  in search time for an arbitrary record is much greater for a secondary index than for a primary index, since we would have to do a linear search  on the data file if the secondary index did not exist. For a primary index, we could still use a binary search on the main file, even if the index did not exist. Example 3 illustrates the improvement in number of blocks accessed. Example 3.\n",

      "In a dense secondary index such as this, the total number of index entries ri is equal to the number of records  in the data file, which is 300,000. The number of blocks needed for the index is hence bi = ⎡(ri/bfri)⎤ = ⎡(300,000/273) ⎤ = 1,099 blocks.\n",

      "This difference arose because the primary index was nondense and hence shorter, with only 28 blocks in length as opposed to the 1,099 blocks dense index here. We can also create a secondary index on a nonkey, nonordering field  of a file. In this case, numerous records in the data file can have the same value for the indexing field. There are several options for implementing such an index: ■Option 1 is to include duplicate index entries with the same K(i) value—one for each record. This would be a dense index.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Option 2 is to have variable-length records for the index entries, with a repeating field for the pointer. We keep a list of pointers < P(i, 1), … , P(i, k)> in the index entry for K(i)—one pointer to each block that contains a record whose indexing field value equals K(i). In either option 1 or option 2, the binary search algorithm on the index must be modified appropriately to account for a variable number of index entries per index key value.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Option 3, which is more commonly used, is to keep the index entries them- selves at a fixed length and have a single entry for each index field value , but to create an extra level of indirection  to handle the multiple pointers. In this nondense scheme, the pointer P(i) in index entry < K(i), P(i)> points to a disk block, which contains a set of record pointers ; each record pointer in that disk block points to one of the data file records with value K(i) for the indexing field.\n",
      "\n",
      "If some value K(i) occurs in too many records, so that their record pointers cannot fit in a single disk block, a cluster or linked list of blocks is used. This technique is illustrated in Figure 17.5. Retrieval via the index requires one or more additional block accesses because of the extra level, but the algorithms for searching the index and (more importantly) for inserting of new records in the data file are straightforward. The binary search algorithm is directly applicable to the index file since it is ordered.\n",

      "\n",
      "In addition, retrievals on complex selection conditions may be handled by referring to the record pointers from multiple non-key secondary indexes, without having to retrieve many unnecessary records from the data file (see Exercise 17.24). Notice that a secondary index provides a logical ordering  on the records by the indexing field. If we access the records in order of the entries in the secondary index, we get them in order of the indexing field. The primary and clustering indexes assume that the field used for physical ordering  of records in the file is the same as the indexing field\n",

      "17.2 Multilevel Indexes The indexing schemes we have described thus far involve an ordered index file. A binary search is applied to the index to locate pointers to a disk block or to a record (or records) in the file having a specific index field value. A binary search requires approximately (log 2 bi) block accesses for an index with bi blocks because each step of the algorithm reduces the part of the index file that we continue to search by a factor of 2. This is why we take the log function to the base 2.\n",

      "The idea behind a multilevel index  is to reduce the part of the index that we continue to search by bfr i, the blocking factor for the index, which is larger than 2.

      "\n",
      "Whereas we divide the record search space  into two halves at each step during a binary search, we divide it n-ways (where n = the fan-out) at each search step using the multilevel index. Searching a multilevel index requires approximately (log fo bi) block accesses, which is a sub- stantially smaller number than for a binary search if the fan-out is larger than 2. In most cases, the fan-out is much larger than 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given a blocksize of 4,096, which is most common in today’s DBMSs, the fan-out depends on how many (key + block pointer) entries fit within a block. With a 4-byte block pointer (which would accommodate 2 32 − 1 = 4.2 *109 blocks) and a 9-byte key such as SSN, the fan-out comes to 315.\n",

Because the second level is a primary index, we can use block anchors so that the second level has one entry for each block  of the first level.\n",

Deletion may cause underflow  by reducing the number of entries in the leaf node to below the minimum required.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, we try to find a sibling leaf node—a leaf node directly to the left or to the right of the node with underflow—and redistribute the entries among the node and its sibling  so that both are at least half full; otherwise, the node is merged with its siblings and the number of leaf nodes is reduced. A common method is to try to redistribute entries with the left sibling; if this is not possible, an attempt to redistribute with the right sibling is made.\n",
      "\n",
      "If this is also not possible, the three nodes are merged into two leaf nodes. In such a case, underflow may propagate to internal  nodes because one fewer tree pointer and search value are needed. This can propagate and reduce the tree levels. Notice that implementing the insertion and deletion algorithms may require par- ent and sibling pointers for each node, or the use of a stack as in Algorithm 17.3. Each node should also include the number of entries in it and its type (leaf or internal). Another alternative is to implement insertion and deletion as recursive procedures.\n",

      "13 Variations of B-Trees and B+-Trees. To conclude this section, we briefly men- tion some variations of B-trees and B+-trees. In some cases, constraint 5 on the B-tree (or for the internal nodes of the B+–tree, except the root node), which requires each node to be at least half full, can be changed to require each node to be at least two-thirds full. In this case the B-tree has been called a B*-tree .\n",

      "In general, some systems allow the user to choose a fill factor  between 0.5 and 1.0, where the latter means that the B-tree (index) nodes are to be completely full.

      "\n",
      "17.4 Indexes on Multiple Keys In our discussion so far, we have assumed that the primary or secondary keys on which files were accessed were single attributes (fields). In many retrieval and update requests, multiple attributes are involved. If a certain combination of attri-butes is used frequently, it is advantageous to set up an access structure to provide efficient access by a key value that is a combination of those attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, consider an EMPLOYEE  file containing attributes Dno (department number), Age, Street , City, Zip_code , Salary  and Skill_code , with the key of Ssn (Social Security number). Consider the query: List the employees in department number 4 whose age is 59 . Note that both Dno and Age are nonkey attributes, which means that a search value for either of these will point to multiple records. The following alternative search strategies may be considered: 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming Dno has an index, but Age does not, access the records having Dno = 4 using the index, and then select from among them those records that satisfy Age = 59. 2. Alternately, if Age is indexed but Dno is not, access the records having Age = 59 using the index, and then select from among them those records that satisfy Dno = 4. 3. If indexes have been created on both Dno and Age, both indexes may be used; each gives a set of records or a set of pointers (to blocks or records).\n",
      "\n",
      "An intersection of these sets of records or pointers yields those records or point-ers that satisfy both conditions. All of these alternatives eventually give the correct result. However, if the set of records that meet each condition ( Dno = 4 or Age = 59) individually are large, yet only a few records satisfy the combined condition, then none of the above is an effi-cient technique for the given search request. Note also that queries such as “find the minimum or maximum age among all employees” can be answered just by using the index on Age, without going to the data file.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding the maximum or minimum age within Dno = 4, however, would not be answerable just by processing the index alone. Also, listing the departments in which employees with Age = 59 work will also not be possible by processing just the indexes. A number of possibilities exist that would treat the combination < Dno, Age> or < Age, Dno> as a search key made up of multiple attributes. We briefly outline these techniques in the following sections. We will refer to keys containing multiple attributes as composite keys .\n",
      "\n",
      "17.4.1 Ordered Index on Multiple Attributes All the discussion in this chapter so far still applies if we create an index on a search key field that is a combination of < Dno, Age>. The search key is a pair of values <4, 59> in the above example. In general, if an index is created on attributes <A1, A2, … , An>, the search key values are tuples with n values: < v1, v2, … , vn>.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lexicographic ordering of these tuple values establishes an order on this compos- ite search key. For our example, all of the department keys for department number 632 Chapter 17 Indexing Structures for Files and Physical Database Design 3 precede those for department number 4. Thus <3, n> precedes <4, m> for any values of m and n. The ascending key order for keys with Dno = 4 would be <4, 18>, <4, 19>, <4, 20>, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lexicographic ordering works similarly to ordering of character strings. An index on a composite key of n attributes works similarly to any index discussed in this chapter so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "17.4.2 Partitioned Hashing Partitioned hashing is an extension of static external hashing (Section 16.8.2) that allows access on multiple keys. It is suitable only for equality comparisons; range queries are not supported. In partitioned hashing, for a key consisting of n compo- nents, the hash function is designed to produce a result with n separate hash addresses. The bucket address is a concatenation of these n addresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is then pos- sible to search for the required composite search key by looking up the appropriate buckets that match the parts of the address in which we are interested. For example, consider the composite search key < Dno, Age>. If Dno and Age are hashed into a 3-bit and 5-bit address respectively, we get an 8-bit bucket address. Suppose that Dno = 4 has a hash address ‘100’ and Age = 59 has hash address ‘10101’.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then to search for the combined search value, Dno = 4 and Age = 59, one goes to bucket address 100 10101; just to search for all employees with Age = 59, all buckets (eight of them) will be searched whose addresses are ‘000 10101’, ‘001 10101’, … and so on. An advantage of partitioned hashing is that it can be easily extended to any number of attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bucket addresses can be designed so that high-order bits in the addresses correspond to more frequently accessed attributes. Addition-ally, no separate access structure needs to be maintained for the individual attri-butes. The main drawback of partitioned hashing is that it cannot handle range queries on any of the component attributes. Additionally, most hash functions do not maintain records in order by the key being hashed. Hence, accessing records in lexicographic order by a combination of attributes such as < Dno, Age> used as a key would not be straightforward or efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "17.4.3 Grid Files Another alternative is to organize the EMPLOYEE  file as a grid file. If we want to access a file on two keys, say Dno and Age as in our example, we can construct a grid array with one linear scale (or dimension) for each of the search attributes. Fig- ure 17.14 shows a grid array for the EMPLOYEE  file with one linear scale for Dno and another for the Age attribute. The scales are made in a way as to achieve a uniform distribution of that attribute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, in our example, we show that the linear scale for Dno has Dno = 1, 2 combined as one value 0 on the scale, whereas Dno = 5 corre- sponds to the value 2 on that scale. Similarly, Age is divided into its scale of 0 to 5 by grouping ages so as to distribute the employees uniformly by age. The grid array shown for this file has a total of 36 cells. Each cell points to some bucket address where the records corresponding to that cell are stored.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 17.14 also shows the assignment of cells to buckets (only partially). 17.5 Other Types of Indexes  633 Thus our request for Dno = 4 and Age = 59 maps into the cell (1, 5) corresponding to the grid array. The records for this combination will be found in the correspond-ing bucket. This method is particularly useful for range queries that would map into a set of cells corresponding to a group of values along the linear scales.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a range query corresponds to a match on the some of the grid cells, it can be processed by accessing exactly the buckets for those grid cells. For example, a query for Dno ≤ 5 and Age > 40 refers to the data in the top bucket shown in Figure 17.14. The grid file concept can be applied to any number of search keys. For example, for n search keys, the grid array would have n dimensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The grid array thus allows a partitioning of the file along the dimensions of the search key attributes and provides an access by combinations of values along those dimensions. Grid files perform well in terms of reduction in time for multiple key access. However, they represent a space overhead in terms of the grid array structure. Moreover, with dynamic files, a frequent reorganization of the file adds to the maintenance cost. 14\n",
      "\n",
      "17.5 Other Types of Indexes\n",
      "\n",
      "17.5.1 Hash Indexes It is also possible to create access structures similar to indexes that are based on hashing . The hash index  is a secondary structure to access the file by using hashing on a search key other than the one used for the primary data file organization. The index entries are of the type < K, Pr> or < K, P>, where Pr is a pointer to the record containing the key, or P is a pointer to the block containing the record for that key.\n",
      "\n",
      "The index file with these index entries can be organized as a dynamically expand- able hash file, using one of the techniques described in Section 16.8.3; searching for an entry uses the hash search algorithm on K.

The Emp_id  is hashed to a bucket number by using a hashing function: the sum of the digits of Emp_id  modulo 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, to find Emp_id 51024, the hash function results in bucket number 2; that bucket is accessed first. It contains the index entry < 51024, Pr >; the pointer Pr leads us to the actual record in the file. In a practical application, there may be thousands of buckets; the bucket number, which may be several bits long, would be subjected to the directory schemes discussed in the context of dynamic hashing in Section 16.8.3. Other search structures can also be used as indexes.\n",

This bitmap has a 0 bit for the rows that have been deleted but are still physically present and a 1 bit for rows that actually exist. Whenever a row is inserted in the relation, an entry must be made in all the bitmaps of all the columns that have a bitmap index; rows typically are appended to the relation or may replace deleted rows to minimize the impact on the reorganization of the bitmaps.

      "17.5.3 Function-Based Indexing In this section, we discuss a new type of indexing, called function-based indexing , that has been introduced in the Oracle relational DBMS as well as in some other commercial products. 15 The idea behind function-based indexing is to create an index such that the value that results from applying some function on a field or a collection of fields becomes the key to the index. The following examples show how to create and use function- based indexes. Example 1.\n",

      "Function-based indexes ensure that Oracle Database system will use the index rather than perform a full table scan, even when a function is used in the search predicate of a query. For example, the following query will use the index: SELECT First_name, Lname FROM EmployeeWHERE UPPER(Lname)= \"SMITH\". Without the function-based index, an Oracle Database might perform a full table scan, since a B+-tree index is searched only by using the column value directly; the use of any function on a column prevents such an index from being used.

      "\n",
      "17.6.1 Logical versus Physical Indexes In the earlier discussion, we have assumed that the index entries < K, Pr> (or < K, P>) always include a physical pointer Pr (or P) that specifies the physical record address on disk as a block number and offset. This is sometimes called a physical index , and it has the disadvantage that the pointer must be changed if the record is moved to another disk location.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, suppose that a primary file organization is based on linear hashing or extendible hashing; then, each time a bucket is split, some records are allocated to new buckets and hence have new physical addresses. If there was a secondary index on the file, the pointers to those records would have to be found and updated, which is a difficult task. To remedy this situation, we can use a structure called a logical index , whose index entries are of the form < K, K p>.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each entry has one value K for the secondary index- ing field matched with the value Kp of the field used for the primary file organiza- tion. By searching the secondary index on the value of K, a program can locate the corresponding value of Kp and use this to access the record through the primary file organization, using a primary index if available. Logical indexes thus introduce an  17.6 Some General Issues Concerning Indexing  639 additional level of indirection between the access structure and the data. They are used when physical record addresses are expected to change frequently.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cost of this indirection is the extra search based on the primary file organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "17.6.2 Index Creation Many RDBMSs have a similar type of command for creating an index, although it is not part of the SQL standard. The general form of this command is: CREATE  [ UNIQUE  ] INDEX  <index name > ON <table name > ( < column name > [ < order > ] { , < column name > [ < order > ] } ) [ CLUSTER  ] ; The keywords UNIQUE  and CLUSTER  are optional.\n",
      "\n",
      "The keyword CLUSTER  is used when the index to be created should also sort the data file records on the indexing attribute. Thus, specifying CLUSTER  on a key (unique) attribute would create some variation of a primary index, whereas specifying CLUSTER  on a nonkey (nonu- nique) attribute would create some variation of a clustering index. The value for < order > can be either ASC (ascending) or DESC (descending), and it specifies whether the data file should be ordered in ascending or descending values of the indexing attribute. The default is ASC.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the following would create a clustering (ascending) index on the nonkey attribute Dno of the EMPLOYEE  file: CREATE  INDEX DnoIndex ON EMPLOYEE  (Dno) CLUSTER  ; Index Creation Process: In many systems, an index is not an integral part of the data file but can be created and discarded dynamically. That is why it is often called an access structure.\n",

      "Whenever we expect to access a file frequently based on some search condition involving a particular field, we can request the DBMS to create an index on that field as shown above for the DnoIndex. Usually, a secondary index is created to avoid physical ordering of the records in the data file on disk. The main advantage of secondary indexes is that—theoretically, at least—they can be created in conjunction with virtually any primary record organization. Hence, a secondary index could be used to complement other primary access methods such as ordering or hashing, or it could even be used with mixed files.\n",
      "\n",
      "To create a B +-tree secondary index on some field of a file, if the file is large and contains millions of records, neither the file nor the index would fit in main memory. Insertion of a large number of entries into the index is done by a process called bulk loading  the index. We must go through all records in the file to create the entries at the leaf level of the tree. These entries are then sorted and filled according to the specified fill fac-tor; simultaneously, the other index levels are created.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is more expensive and much harder to create primary indexes and clustering indexes dynamically, because the records of the data file must be physically sorted on disk in order of the indexing field. However, some systems allow users to create these indexes dynamically on their files by sorting the file during index creation.640 Chapter 17 Indexing Structures for Files and Physical Database Design Indexing of Strings: There are a couple of issues that are of particular concern when indexing strings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strings can be variable length (e.g., VARCHAR data type in SQL; see Chapter 6) and strings may be too long limiting the fan-out. If a B +-tree index is to be built with a string as a search key, there may be an uneven number of keys per index node and the fan-out may vary. Some nodes may be forced to split when they become full regardless of the number of keys in them. The technique of prefix compression  alleviates the situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of storing the entire string in the intermediate nodes, it stores only the prefix of the search key adequate to distin-guish the keys that are being separated and directed to the subtree. For example, if Lastname was a search key and we were looking for “Navathe”, the nonleaf node may contain “Nac” for Nachamkin and “Nay” for Nayuddin as the two keys on either side of the subtree pointer that we need to follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "17.6.3 Tuning Indexes The initial choice of indexes may have to be revised for the following reasons: ■Certain queries may take too long to run for lack of an index. ■Certain indexes may not get utilized at all. ■Certain indexes may undergo too much updating because the index is on an attribute that undergoes frequent changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most DBMSs have a command or trace facility, which can be used by the DBA to ask the system to show how a query was executed—what operations were per-formed in what order and what secondary access structures (indexes) were used. By analyzing these execution plans (we will discuss this term further in Chapter 18), it is possible to diagnose the causes of the above problems. Some indexes may be dropped and some new indexes may be created based on the tuning analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of tuning is to dynamically evaluate the requirements, which sometimes fluctuate seasonally or during different times of the month or week, and to reorga- nize the indexes and file organizations to yield the best overall performance. Drop- ping and building new indexes is an overhead that can be justified in terms of performance improvements. Updating of a table is generally suspended while an index is dropped or created; this loss of service must be accounted for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides dropping or creating indexes and changing from a nonclustered to a clus- tered index and vice versa, rebuilding the index  may improve performance. Most RDBMSs use B +-trees for an index. If there are many deletions on the index key, index pages may contain wasted space, which can be claimed during a rebuild oper-ation. Similarly, too many insertions may cause overflows in a clustered index that affect performance. Rebuilding a clustered index amounts to reorganizing the entire table ordered on that key.\n",
      "\n",
      "The available options for indexing and the way they are defined, created, and reorganized vary from system to system. As an illustration, consider the sparse and dense indexes we discussed in Section 17.1. A sparse index such as a primary index will have one index pointer for each page (disk block) in the data file; a  17.6 Some General Issues Concerning Indexing  641 dense index such as a unique secondary index will have an index pointer for each record.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sybase provides clustering indexes as sparse indexes in the form of  B +-trees, whereas INGRES provides sparse clustering indexes as ISAM files and dense clustering indexes as B+-trees. In some versions of Oracle and DB2, the option of setting up a clustering index is limited to a dense index, and the DBA has to work with this limitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "17.6.4  Additional Issues Related to Storage of Relations and Indexes Using an Index for Managing Constraints and Duplicates: It is common to use an index to enforce a key constraint  on an attribute. While searching the index to insert a new record, it is straightforward to check at the same time whether another record in the file—and hence in the index tree—has the same key attribute value as the new record. If so, the insertion can be rejected.\n",
      "\n",
      "If an index is created on a nonkey field, duplicates  occur; handling of these dupli- cates is an issue the DBMS product vendors have to deal with and affects data stor- age as well as index creation and management. Data records for the duplicate key may be contained in the same block or may span multiple blocks where many duplicates are possible. Some systems add a row id to the record so that records with duplicate keys have their own unique identifiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In such cases, the B +-tree index may regard a <key, Row_id> combination as the de facto key for the index, turning the index into a unique index with no duplicates. The deletion of a key K from such an index would involve deleting all occurrences of that key K—hence the deletion algorithm has to account for this. In actual DBMS products, deletion from B+-tree indexes is also handled in various ways to improve performance and response times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deleted records may be marked as deleted and the corresponding index entries may also not be removed until a garbage collection process reclaims the space in the data file; the index is rebuilt online after garbage collection. Inverted Files and Other Access Methods: A file that has a secondary index on every one of its fields is often called a fully inverted file . Because all indexes are secondary, new records are inserted at the end of the file; therefore, the data file itself is an unordered (heap) file.\n",
      "\n",
      "The indexes are usually implemented as B+-trees, so they are updated dynamically to reflect insertion or deletion of records. Some commercial DBMSs, such as Software AG’s Adabas, use this method extensively. We referred to the popular IBM file organization called ISAM in Section 17.2. Another IBM method, the virtual storage access method  (VSAM ), is somewhat similar to the B+–tree access structure and is still being used in many commercial systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using Indexing Hints in Queries: DBMSs such as Oracle have a provision for allowing hints in queries that are suggested alternatives or indicators to the query 642 Chapter 17 Indexing Structures for Files and Physical Database Design processor and optimizer for expediting query execution. One form of hints is called indexing hints; these hints suggest the use of an index to improve the execution of a query.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hints appear as a special comment (which is preceded by +) and they override all optimizer decisions, but they may be ignored by the optimizer if they are invalid, irrelevant, or improperly formulated. We do not get into a detailed dis-cussion of indexing hints, but illustrate with an example query.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, to retrieve the SSN, Salary, and department number for employees working in department numbers with Dno less than 10: SELECT /*+ INDEX (EMPLOYEE emp_dno_index ) */ Emp_ssn, Salary, Dno FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Dno < 10; The above query includes a hint to use a valid index called emp_dno_index (which is an index on the EMPLOYEE relation on Dno).\n",
      "\n",
      "Column-Based Storage of Relations: There has been a recent trend to con- sider a column-based storage of relations as an alternative to the traditional way of storing relations row by row. Commercial relational DBMSs have offered B +-tree indexing on primary as well as secondary keys as an efficient mechanism to support access to data by various search criteria and the ability to write a row or a set of rows to disk at a time to produce write-optimized systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "For data warehouses (to be discussed in Chapter 29), which are read-only databases, the column-based storage offers particular advantages for read-only queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typically, the column-store RDBMSs consider storing each column of data individually and afford performance advantages in the following areas: ■Vertically partitioning the table column by column, so that a two-column table can be constructed for every attribute and thus only the needed col- umns can be accessed ■Using column-wise indexes (similar to the bitmap indexes discussed in Sec- tion 17.5.2) and join indexes on multiple tables to answer queries without having to access the data tables ■Using materialized views (see Chapter 7) to support queries on multiple columns Column-wise storage of data affords additional freedom in the creation of indexes, such as the bitmap indexes discussed earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same column may be present in multiple projections of a table and indexes may be created on each projection. To store the values in the same column, strategies for data compression, null-value suppression, dictionary encoding techniques (where distinct values in the column are assigned shorter codes), and run-length encoding techniques have been devised. MonetDB/X100, C-Store, and Vertica are examples of such systems Some popular systems (like Cassandra, Hbase, and Hypertable) have used column-based storage effectively with the concept of wide column-stores .\n",

      "17.7  Physical Database Design   in Relational Databases In this section, we discuss the physical design factors that affect the performance of applications and transactions, and then we comment on the specific guidelines for RDBMSs in the context of what we discussed in Chapter 16 and this chapter so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "17.7.1 Factors That Influence Physical Database Design Physical design is an activity where the goal is not only to create the appropriate structuring of data in storage, but also to do so in a way that guarantees good per-formance. For a given conceptual schema, there are many physical design alterna-tives in a given DBMS. It is not possible to make meaningful physical design decisions and performance analyses until the database designer knows the mix of queries, transactions, and applications that are expected to run on the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is called the job mix  for the particular set of database system applications. The database administrators/designers must analyze these applications, their expected frequencies of invocation, any timing constraints on their execution speed, the expected frequency of update operations, and any unique constraints on attributes. We discuss each of these factors next. A. Analyzing the Database Queries and Transactions. Before undertaking the physical database design, we must have a good idea of the intended use of the database by defining in a high-level form the queries and transactions that are expected to run on the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "For each retrieval query , the following informa- tion about the query would be needed: 1. The files (relations) that will be accessed by the query 2. The attributes on which any selection conditions for the query are specified 3. Whether the selection condition is an equality, inequality, or a range condition 4. The attributes on which any join conditions or conditions to link multiple tables or objects for the query are specified 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "The attributes whose values will be retrieved by the query The attributes listed in items 2 and 4 above are candidates for the definition of access structures, such as indexes, hash keys, or sorting of the file. For each update operation  or update transaction , the following information would be needed: 1. The files that will be updated 2. The type of operation on each file (insert, update, or delete) 3. The attributes on which selection conditions for a delete or update are specified 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "The attributes whose values will be changed by an update operation Again, the attributes listed in item 3 are candidates for access structures on the files, because they would be used to locate the records that will be updated or deleted. On 644 Chapter 17 Indexing Structures for Files and Physical Database Design the other hand, the attributes listed in item 4 are candidates for avoiding an access structure , since modifying them will require updating the access structures. B. Analyzing the Expected Frequency of Invocation of Queries and Transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides identifying the characteristics of expected retrieval que- ries and update transactions, we must consider their expected rates of invocation. This frequency information, along with the attribute information collected on each query and transaction, is used to compile a cumulative list of the expected frequency of use for all queries and transactions. This is expressed as the expected frequency of using each attribute in each file as a selection attribute or a join attri-bute, over all the queries and transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, for large volumes of pro-cessing, the informal 80–20 rule  can be used: approximately 80% of the processing is accounted for by only 20% of the queries and transactions. Therefore, in practi-cal situations, it is rarely necessary to collect exhaustive statistics and invocation rates on all the queries and transactions; it is sufficient to determine the 20% or so most important ones. C. Analyzing the Time Constraints of Queries and Transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some que- ries and transactions may have stringent performance constraints. For example, a transaction may have the constraint that it should terminate within 5 seconds on 95% of the occasions when it is invoked, and that it should never take more than 20 seconds. Such timing constraints place further priorities on the attributes that are candidates for access paths. The selection attributes used by queries and transac-tions with time constraints become higher-priority candidates for primary access structures for the files, because the primary access structures are generally the most efficient for locating records in a file.\n",
      "\n",
      "D. Analyzing the Expected Frequencies of Update Operations. A minimum number of access paths should be specified for a file that is frequently updated, because updating the access paths themselves slows down the update operations. For example, if a file that has frequent record insertions has 10 indexes on 10 different attributes, each of these indexes must be updated whenever a new record is inserted. The overhead for updating 10 indexes can slow down the insert operations. E. Analyzing the Uniqueness Constraints on Attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Access paths should be specified on all candidate key  attributes—or sets of attributes—that are either the primary key of a file or unique attributes. The existence of an index (or other access path) makes it sufficient to search only the index when checking this uniqueness constraint, since all values of the attribute will exist in the leaf nodes of the index. For example, when inserting a new record, if a key attribute value of the new record already exists in the index , the insertion of the new record should be rejected, since it would violate the uniqueness constraint on the attribute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the preceding information is compiled, it is possible to address the physical database design decisions, which consist mainly of deciding on the storage struc- tures and access paths for the database files. 17.7 Physical Database Design in Relational Databases  645\n",
      "\n",
      "17.7.2 Physical Database Design Decisions Most relational systems represent each base relation as a physical database file. The access path options include specifying the type of primary file organization for each relation and the attributes that are candidates for defining individual or composite indexes. At most, one of the indexes on each file may be a primary or a clustering index. Any number of additional secondary indexes can be created. Design Decisions about Indexing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The attributes whose values are required in equality or range conditions (selection operation) are those that are keys or that participate in join conditions (join operation) requiring access paths, such as indexes. The performance of queries largely depends upon what indexes or hashing schemes exist to expedite the processing of selections and joins. On the other hand, during insert, delete, or update operations, the existence of indexes adds to the overhead. This overhead must be justified in terms of the gain in efficiency by expediting que-ries and transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The physical design decisions for indexing fall into the following categories: 1. Whether to index an attribute. The general rules for creating an index on an attribute are that the attribute must either be a key (unique), or there must be some query that uses that attribute either in a selection condition (equality or range of values) or in a join condition. One reason for creating multiple indexes is that some operations can be processed by just scanning the indexes, without having to access the actual data file. 2. What attribute or attributes to index on.\n",
      "\n",
      "An index can be constructed on a single attribute, or on more than one attribute if it is a composite index. If multiple attributes from one relation are involved together in several que-ries, (for example, (Garment_style_#, Color)  in a garment inventory database), a multiattribute (composite) index is warranted. The ordering of attributes within a multiattribute index must correspond to the queries. For instance, the above index assumes that queries would be based on an ordering of col-ors within a Garment_style_#  rather than vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Whether to set up a clustered index. At most, one index per table can be a primary or clustering index, because this implies that the file be physically ordered on that attribute. In most RDBMSs, this is specified by the keyword CLUSTER . (If the attribute is a key, a primary index  is created, whereas a clustering index  is created if the attribute is not a key .)\n",
      "\n",
      "If a table requires sev- eral indexes, the decision about which one should be the primary or cluster-ing index depends upon whether keeping the table ordered on that attribute is needed. Range queries benefit a great deal from clustering. If several attri-butes require range queries, relative benefits must be evaluated before decid-ing which attribute to cluster on.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a query is to be answered by doing an index search only (without retrieving data records), the corresponding index should not be clustered, since the main benefit of clustering is achieved 646 Chapter 17 Indexing Structures for Files and Physical Database Design when retrieving the records themselves. A clustering index may be set up as a multiattribute index if range retrieval by that composite key is useful in report creation (for example, an index on Zip_code , Store_id , and Product_id may be a clustering index for sales data). 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether to use a hash index over a tree index. In general, RDBMSs use B+-trees for indexing. However, ISAM and hash indexes are also provided in some systems. B+-trees support both equality and range queries on the attri- bute used as the search key. Hash indexes work well with equality condi-tions, particularly during joins to find a matching record(s), but they do not support range queries. 5. Whether to use dynamic hashing for the file.\n",
      "\n",
      "For files that are very volatile— that is, those that grow and shrink continuously—one of the dynamic hashing schemes discussed in Section 16.9 would be suitable. Currently, such schemes are not offered by many commercial RDBMSs.\n",
      "\n",
      "17.8  Summary   In this chapter, we presented file organizations that involve additional access struc-tures, called indexes, to improve the efficiency of retrieval of records from a data file. These access structures may be used in conjunction with  the primary file orga- nizations discussed in Chapter 16, which are used to organize the file records them- selves on disk. Three types of ordered single-level indexes were introduced: primary, clustering, and secondary. Each index is specified on a field of the file.\n",
      "\n",
      "Primary and cluster- ing indexes are constructed on the physical ordering field of a file, whereas sec-ondary indexes are specified on nonordering fields as additional access structures to improve performance of queries and transactions. The field for a primary index must also be a key of the file, whereas it is a nonkey field for a clustering index. A single-level index is an ordered file and is searched using a binary search. We showed how multilevel indexes can be constructed to improve the efficiency of searching an index.\n",
      "\n",
      "An example is IBM’s popular indexed sequential access method (ISAM), which is a multilevel index based on the cylinder/track configu-ration on disk. Next we showed how multilevel indexes can be implemented as B-trees and B +-trees, which are dynamic structures that allow an index to expand and shrink dynamically. The nodes (blocks) of these index structures are kept between half full and completely full by the insertion and deletion algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nodes eventually sta- bilize at an average occupancy of 69% full, allowing space for insertions without requiring reorganization of the index for the majority of insertions. B+-trees can generally hold more entries in their internal nodes than can B-trees, so they may have fewer levels or hold more entries than does a corresponding B-tree. We gave an overview of multiple key access methods, and we showed how an index can be constructed based on hash data structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "We introduced the concept of  Review Questions  647 partitioned hashing , which is an extension of external hashing to deal with mul- tiple keys. We also introduced grid files , which organize data into buckets along multiple dimensions, We discussed the hash index  in some detail—it is a second- ary structure to access the file by using hashing on a search key other than that used for the primary organization. Bitmap indexing  is another important type of indexing used for querying by multiple keys and is particularly applicable on fields with a small number of unique values.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitmaps can also be used at the leaf nodes of B + tree indexes as well. We also discussed function-based indexing, which is being provided by relational vendors to allow special indexes on a function of one or more attributes. We introduced the concept of a logical index and compared it with the physical indexes we described before. They allow an additional level of indirection in index-ing in order to permit greater freedom for movement of actual record locations on disk. We discussed index creation in SQL, the process of bulk loading of index files and indexing of strings.\n",
      "\n",
      "We discussed circumstances that point to tuning of indexes. Then we reviewed some general topics related to indexing, including managing constraints, using inverted indexes, and using indexing hints in queries; we com-mented on column-based storage of relations, which is becoming a viable alterna-tive for storing and accessing large databases. Finally, we discussed physical database design of relational databases, which involves decisions related to storage and accessing of data that we have been discussing in the current and the previous chapter.\n",
      "\n",
      "This discussion was divided into factors that influence the design and the types of decisions regarding whether to index an attribute, what attributes to include in an index, clustered versus nonclustered indexes, hashed indexes, and dynamic hashing. Review Questions\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, SQL is the query language that is used in most commercial RDBMSs. An SQL query is first translated into an equivalent extended relational algebra expression—represented as a query tree data structure—that is then optimized. Typically, SQL queries are decomposed into query blocks , which form the basic units that can be translated into the algebraic operators and optimized. A query block  contains a single SELECT-FROM-WHERE  expression, as well as GROUP BY 3There are some query processing and optimization issues and techniques that are pertinent only to ODBMSs.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, we do not discuss them here because we give only an introduction to query processing in this chapter and we do not discuss query optimization until Chapter 19.658 Chapter 18 Strategies for Query Processing and HAVING  clauses if these are part of the block. Hence, nested queries within a query are identified as separate query blocks. Because SQL includes aggregate operators—such as MAX , MIN, SUM , and COUNT —these operators must also be included in the extended algebra, as we discussed in Section 8.4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider the following SQL query on the EMPLOYEE  relation in Figure 5.5: SELECT  Lname, Fname FROM  EMPLOYEE WHERE  Salary  > ( SELECT  MAX  (Salary) FROM     EMPLOYEE WHERE   Dno =5 ); This query retrieves the names of employees (from any department in the com- pany) who earn a salary that is greater than the highest salary in department 5 . The query includes a nested subquery and hence would be decomposed into two blocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inner block is: ( SELECT  MAX  (Salary) FROM     EMPLOYEE WHERE   Dno =5 ) This retrieves the highest salary in department 5. The outer query block is: SELECT   Lname, Fname FROM    EMPLOYEE WHERE  Salary  > c where c represents the result returned from the inner block.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inner block could be translated into the following extended relational algebra expression: ℑMAX Salary (σDno=5(EMPLOYEE)) and the outer block into the expression: πLname,Fname (σSalary>c (EMPLOYEE)) The query optimizer  would then choose an execution plan for each query block. Notice that in the above example, the inner block needs to be evaluated only once to produce the maximum salary of employees in department 5, which is then used—as the constant c—by the outer block.\n",
      "\n",
      "We called this a nested subquery block  (which is uncorrelated to the outer query block ) in Section 7.1.2. It is more involved to opti- mize the more complex correlated nested subqueries  (see Section 7.1.3), where a tuple variable from the outer query block appears in the WHERE -clause of the inner query block. Many techniques are used in advanced DBMSs to unnest and optimize correlated nested subqueries.\n",

      "18.1.1 Additional Operators Semi-Join and Anti-Join Most RDBMSs currently process SQL queries arising from various types of enterprise applications that include ad hoc queries, standard canned queries with parameters,  18.1 Translating SQL Queries into Relational Algebra and Other Operators  659 and queries for report generation. Additionally, SQL queries originate from OLAP (online analytical processing) applications on data warehouses (we discuss data warehousing in detail in Chapter 29).\n",

For example, whenever an SQL query specifies an ORDER BY -clause, the query result must be sorted. Sorting is also a key component in sort-merge algorithms used for JOIN  and  18.2 Algorithms for External Sorting  661 other operations (such as UNION  and INTERSECTION ), and in duplicate elimination algorithms for the PROJECT  operation (when an SQL query specifies the DISTINCT option in the SELECT  clause).\n",
      "\n",
      "We will discuss one of these algorithms in this sec- tion. Note that sorting of a particular file may be avoided if an appropriate index—such as a primary or clustering index (see Chapter 17)—exists on the desired file attribute to allow ordered access to the records of the file. External sorting  refers to sorting algorithms that are suitable for large files of records stored on disk that do not fit entirely in main memory, such as most data- base files.\n",
      "\n",
      "6 The typical external sorting algorithm uses a sort-merge strategy , which starts by sorting small subfiles—called runs —of the main file and then merges the sorted runs, creating larger sorted subfiles that are merged in turn. The sort-merge algorithm, like other database algorithms, requires buffer space  in main memory, where the actual sorting and merging of the runs is performed. The basic algorithm, outlined in Figure 18.2, consists of two phases: the sorting phase and the merging phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "The buffer space in main memory is part of the DBMS cache —an area in the computer’s main memory that is controlled by the DBMS. The buffer space is divided into individual buffers, where each buffer  is the same size in bytes as the size of one disk block. Thus, one buffer can hold the contents of exactly one disk block . In the sorting phase , runs (portions or pieces) of the file that can fit in the available buffer space are read into main memory, sorted using an internal  sorting algorithm, and written back to disk as temporary sorted subfiles (or runs).\n",
      "\n",
      "The size of each run and the number of initial runs ( n R) are dictated by the number of file blocks ( b) and the available buffer space ( nB). For example, if the number of available main memory buffers nB = 5 disk blocks and the size of the file b = 1,024 disk blocks, then nR= ⎡(b/nB)⎤ or 205 initial runs each of size 5 blocks (except the last run, which will have only 4 blocks).\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, after the sorting phase, 205 sorted runs (or 205 sorted subfiles of the original file) are stored as temporary subfiles on disk. In the merging phase , the sorted runs are merged during one or more merge passes . Each merge pass can have one or more merge steps. The degree of merging ( dM) is the number of sorted subfiles that can be merged in each merge step.\n",
      "\n",
      "During each merge step, one buffer block is needed to hold one disk block from each of the sorted subfiles being merged, and one additional buffer is needed for containing one disk block of the merge result, which will produce a larger sorted file that is the result of merging several smaller sorted subfiles. Hence, d M is the smaller of ( nB − 1) and nR, and the number of merge passes is ⎡(log dM(nR))⎤.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our example, where nB = 5, dM = 4 (four-way merging), so the 205 initial sorted runs would be merged 4 at a time in each step into 52 larger sorted subfiles at the end of the first merge pass. These 52 sorted files are then merged 4 at a time into 13 sorted files, which are then merged into 4 sorted files, and then finally into 1 fully sorted file, which means that four passes  are needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "6Internal sorting algorithms  are suitable for sorting data structures, such as tables and lists, that can fit entirely in main memory. These algorithms are described in detail in data structures and algorithms texts, and include techniques such as quick sort, heap sort, bubble sort, and many others. We do not discuss these here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, main-memory DBMSs such as HANA employ their own techniques for sorting.662 Chapter 18 Strategies for Query Processing The performance of the sort-merge algorithm can be measured in terms of the number of disk block reads and writes (between the disk and main memory) before the sorting of the whole file is completed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following formula approxi-mates this cost: (2 * b) + (2 * b * (log dM nR)) The first term (2 * b) represents the number of block accesses for the sorting phase, since each file block is accessed twice: once for reading into a main memory buffer and once for writing the sorted records back to disk into one of the sorted subfiles. The second term represents the number of block accesses for the merging phase. During each merge pass, a number of disk blocks approximately equal to the original file blocks b is read and written.\n",

An effort is made to keep these statistics as accurate as possible; how- ever, keeping them accurate up-to-the-minute is considered unnecessary since the overhead of doing so in fairly active databases is too high.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will be revisiting many of the above parameters again in Section 19.3.2. When the optimizer is choosing between multiple simple conditions in a conjunc- tive select condition, it typically considers the selectivity  of each condition. The selectivity ( sl) is defined as the ratio of the number of records (tuples) that satisfy the condition to the total number of records (tuples) in the file (relation), and thus it is a number between zero and one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zero selectivity  means none of the records in the file satisfies the selection condition, and a selectivity of one means that all the records in the file satisfy the condition. In general, the selectivity will not be either of these two extremes, but will be a fraction that estimates the percentage of file records that will be retrieved. Although exact selectivities of all conditions may not be available, estimates of selectivities  are possible from the information kept in the DBMS catalog and are used by the optimizer.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, for an equality condition on a key attribute of relation r(R), s = 1/| r(R)|, where | r(R)| is the number of tuples in relation r(R). For an equality condition on a nonkey attribute with i distinct values, s  can be estimated by 668 Chapter 18 Strategies for Query Processing (|r(R)|/i)/|r(R)| or 1/ i, assuming that the records are evenly or uniformly distributed among the distinct values.\n",

For a range query with the selection condition, A ≥ v, assuming uniform distribution, sl = 0 if v > max (A, R)sl = max (A, R) – v / max (A, R) – min (A, R) In general, the number of records satisfying a selection condition with selectivity sl is estimated to be | r(R)| * sl.

The same holds for the formulas developed later for other join algorithms. As this example shows, it is advantageous to use the file with fewer blocks  as the outer-loop file in the nested-loop join.\n",

      "18.4.3  How the Join Selection Factor Affects Join Performance Another factor that affects the performance of a join, particularly the single-loop method J2, is the fraction of records in one file that will be joined with records in the other file. We call this the join selection factor 13 of a file with respect to an equijoin condition with another file. This factor depends on the particular equijoin condition between the two files.\n",

Here, each DEPARTMENT  record (there are 50 such records in our example) will be joined with a single  EMPLOYEE  record, but many EMPLOYEE records (the 5,950 of them that do not manage a department) will not be joined with any record from DEPARTMENT .\n",

We have two options for implementing method J2. The first retrieves each EMPLOYEE  record and then uses the index on Mgr_ssn  of DEPARTMENT  to find a matching DEPARTMENT  record. In this case, no matching record will be found for employees who do not manage a department.\n",

      "The number of block accesses for this case is approximately: b E + (rE * (xMgr_ssn  + 1)) = 2000 + (6000 * 3) = 20,000 block accesses The second option retrieves each DEPARTMENT  record and then uses the index on Ssn of EMPLOYEE  to find a matching manager EMPLOYEE  record. In this case, every DEPARTMENT  record will have one matching EMPLOYEE  record.\n",

      "The number of block accesses for this case is approximately: bD + (rD * (xSsn + 1)) = 10 + (50 * 5) = 260 block accesses The second option is more efficient because the join selection factor of DEPART MENT with respect to the join condition  Ssn = Mgr_ssn  is 1 (every record in DEPARTMENT will be joined), whereas the join selection factor of EMPLOYEE  with respect to the same join condition is (50/6,000), or 0.008 (only 0.8% of the records in EMPLOYEE will be joined).\n",
      "\n",
      "For method J2, either the smaller file or the file that has a match for every record (that is, the file with the high join selection factor) should be used in the (single) join loop. It is also possible to create an index specifically for perform- ing the join operation if one does not already exist. 13This is different from the join selectivity , which we will discuss in Chapter 19.674 Chapter 18 Strategies for Query Processing The sort-merge join J3 is quite efficient if both files are already sorted by their join attribute.\n",

If the hash table for the smaller of the two files can be kept entirely in main memory after hashing (parti-tioning) on its join attribute, the implementation is straightforward. If, however, the partitions of both files must be stored on disk, the method becomes more com-plex, and a number of variations to improve the efficiency have been proposed.\n",

      "We discuss two techniques: the general case of partition-hash join  and a variation called hybrid hash-join algorithm , which has been shown to be efficient. In the general case of partition-hash join , each file is first partitioned into M parti- tions using the same partitioning hash function  on the join attributes. Then, each pair of corresponding partitions is joined.\n",

      "For example, suppose we are joining relations R and S on the join attributes R.A and S.B: R A=B S In the partitioning phase , R is partitioned into the M partitions R1, R2, … , RM, and S into the M partitions S1, S2, …, SM. The property of each pair of corresponding parti- tions Ri, Si with respect to the join operation is that records in Ri only need to be joined with records in Si, and vice versa.\n",
      "\n",
      "This property is ensured by using the same hash function  to partition both files on their join attributes—attribute A for R and attribute B for S. The minimum number of in-memory buffers needed for the partitioning phase  is M + 1. Each of the files R and S is partitioned separately. During partitioning of a file, M in-memory buffers are allocated to store the records that hash to each par- tition, and one additional buffer is needed to hold one block at a time of the input file being partitioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever the in-memory buffer for a partition gets filled, its con-tents are appended to a disk subfile  that stores the partition. The partitioning phase has two iterations. After the first iteration, the first file R is partitioned into the subfiles R 1, R2, … , RM, where all the records that hashed to the same buffer are in the same partition. After the second iteration, the second file S is similarly partitioned. In the second phase, called the joining  or probing phase , M iterations  are needed.\n",

The minimum 14We can use the more accurate formulas from Section 19.5 if we know the number of available buffers for sorting. 18.4 Implementing the JOIN Operation  675 number of buffers needed for iteration i is the number of blocks in the smaller of the two partitions, say Ri, plus two additional buffers.\n",

      "If we use a nested-loop join during iteration i, the records from the smaller of the two partitions Ri are copied into memory buffers; then all blocks from the other partition Si are read—one at a time—and each record is used to probe  (that is, search) partition Ri for matching record(s). Any matching records are joined and written into the result file.\n",
      "\n",
      "To improve the efficiency of in-memory probing, it is common to use an in-memory hash table  for storing the records in partition R i by using a different  hash func- tion from the partitioning hash function.15 We can approximate the cost of this partition hash-join as 3 * (bR + bS) + bRES for our example, since each record is read once and written back to disk once during the partitioning phase. During the joining (probing) phase, each record is read a second time to perform the join.\n",

      "Notice that if the available in-memory buffer space n B > (bR + 2), where bR is the number of blocks for the smaller  of the two files being joined, say R, then there is no reason to do partitioning since in this case the join can be performed entirely in memory using some variation of the nested-loop join based on hashing and probing.\n",

      "For the second pass of the partitioning phase, the records of the second file being joined—the larger file, EMPLOYEE  in OP6 —are being partitioned. If a record hashes to the first partition,  it is joined with the matching record in DEPARTMENT and the joined records are written to the result buffer (and eventually to disk). If an EMPLOYEE  record hashes to a partition other than the first, it is partitioned normally and stored to disk.\n",

      "Getting the true effect of the relational algebra π <attribute list> (R) operator is straight- forward to implement if <attribute list> includes a key of relation R, because in this case the result of the operation will have the same number of tuples as R, but with only the values for the attributes in <attribute list> in each tuple. If <attribute list> does not include a key of R, duplicate tuples must be eliminated. This can be done by sorting the result of the operation and then eliminating duplicate tuples, which appear consecutively after sorting.\n",

Hashing can also be used to eliminate duplicates: as each record is hashed and inserted into a bucket of the hash file in memory, it is checked against those records already in the bucket; if it is a duplicate, it is not inserted in the bucket. It is useful to recall here that in SQL queries, the default is not to eliminate dupli-cates from the query result; duplicates are eliminated from the query result only if the keyword DISTINCT  is included.\n",

      "In particular, the CARTESIAN  PRODUCT  operation R × S is expensive because its result includes a record for each combination of records from R and S. Also, each record in the result includes all attributes of R and S. If R has n records and j attri- butes, and S has m records and k attributes, the result relation for R × S will have n * m records and each record will have j + k attributes. Hence, it is important to avoid the CARTESIAN  PRODUCT  operation and to substitute other operations such as join during query optimization.\n",

      "\n",
      "For example, consider the following SQL query: SELECT  MAX (Salary) FROM  EMPLOYEE ; If an (ascending) B+-tree index on Salary  exists for the EMPLOYEE  relation, then the optimizer can decide on using the Salary  index to search for the largest Salary value in the index by following the rightmost  pointer in each index node from the  18.6 Implementing Aggregate Operations and Different Types of JOINs  679 root to the rightmost leaf.\n",

In most cases, this would be more efficient than a full table scan of EMPLOYEE , since no actual records need to be retrieved. The MIN function can be handled in a similar manner, except that the leftmost  pointer in the index is fol- lowed from the root to leftmost leaf. That node would include the smallest Salary value as its first entry.\n",

In this case, the associated computation would be applied to the values in the index. For a nondense index , the actual number of records associated with each index value must be used for a correct computation. This can be done if the number of records associated with each value  in the index is stored in each index entry.\n",

      "For the COUNT  aggregate function, the number of values can be also computed from the index in a similar manner. If a COUNT( *) function is applied to a whole relation, the number of records currently in each relation are typically stored in the catalog, and so the result can be retrieved directly from the catalog. When a GROUP BY  clause is used in a query, the aggregate operator must be applied separately to each group of tuples as partitioned by the grouping attribute.\n",

In Section 6.4, we discussed the outer join operation , with its three variations: left outer join, right outer join, and full outer join.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Chapter 5, we 680 Chapter 18 Strategies for Query Processing discussed how these operations can be specified in SQL. The following is an exam- ple of a left outer join operation in SQL: SELECT  E.Lname , E.Fname , D.Dname FROM  (EMPLOYEE E LEFT OUTER JOIN  DEPARTMENT D ON E.Dno  = D. Dnumber ); The result of this query is a table of employee names and their associated depart- ments.\n",

      "The table contains the same results as a regular (inner) join, with the excep-tion that if an EMPLOYEE  tuple (a tuple in the left relation) does not have an associated department,  the employee’s name will still appear in the resulting table, but the department name would be NULL  for such tuples in the query result. Outer join can be looked upon as a combination of inner join and anti-join. Outer join can be computed by modifying one of the join algorithms, such as nested-loop join or single-loop join.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, to compute a left outer join, we use the left relation as the outer loop or index-based nested loop because every tuple in the left relation must appear in the result. If there are matching tuples in the other relation, the joined tuples are produced and saved in the result. However, if no matching tuple is found, the tuple is still included in the result but is padded with NULL  value(s). The sort-merge and hash-join algorithms can also be extended to compute outer joins.\n",

      "Theoretically, outer join can also be computed by executing a combination of rela- tional algebra operators. For example, the left outer join operation shown above is equivalent to the following sequence of relational operations: 1. Compute the (inner) JOIN  of the EMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT  tables.

In Section 18.1, we introduced these types of joins as possible operations to which some queries with nested subqueries get mapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose is to be able to perform some variant of join instead of evaluat- ing the subquery multiple times. Use of inner join would be invalid in these cases, since for every tuple of the outer relation, the inner join looks for all possible matches on the inner relation. In semi-join, the search stops as soon as the first match is found and the tuple from outer relation is selected; in anti-join, search stops as soon as the first match is found and the tuple from outer relation is rejected.\n",

      "Both these types of joins can be implemented as an extension of the join algorithms we discussed in Section 18.4. Implementing Non-Equi-Join  Join operation may also be performed when the join condition is one of inequality.

If we execute a single operation at a time, we must generate temporary files on disk to hold the results of these tempo- rary operations, creating excessive overhead. Evaluating a query by creating and storing each temporary result and then passing it as an argument for the next oper-ator is called materialized evaluation .\n",

      "18.7.1 Iterators for implementing Physical Operations Various algorithms for algebraic operations involve reading some input in the form of one or more files, processing it, and generating an output file as a relation. If the operation is implemented in such a way that it outputs one tuple at a time, then it can be regarded as an iterator . For example, we can devise a tuple-based imple- mentation of the nested-loop join that will generate a tuple at a time as output.\n",
      "\n",
      "Iterators work in contrast with the materialization approach wherein entire rela-tions are produced as temporary results and stored on disk or main memory and are read back again by the next algorithm. The query plan that contains the query tree may be executed by invoking the iterators in a certain order. Many iterators may be active at one time, thereby passing results up the execution tree and avoid-ing the need for additional storage of temporary results. The iterator interface typi-cally consists of the following methods: 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open (): This method initializes the operator by allocating buffers for its input and output and initializing any data structures needed for the opera-tor. It is also used to pass arguments such as selection conditions needed to perform the operation. It in turn calls Open() to get the arguments it needs. 2. Get_Next (): This method calls the Get_next() on each of its input argu-ments and calls the code specific to the operation being performed on the inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next output tuple generated is returned and the state of the iterator is updated to keep track of the amount of input processed. When no more tuples can be returned, it places some special value in the output buffer. 18.8 Parallel Algorithms for Query Processing  683 3. Close(): This method ends the iteration after all tuples that can be generated have been generated, or the required/demanded number of tuples have been returned. It also calls Close() on the arguments of the iterator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each iterator may be regarded as a class for its implementation with the above three methods applicable to each instance of that class. If the operator to be imple-mented allows a tuple to be completely processed when it is received, it may be possible to use the pipelining strategy effectively. However, if the input tuples need to be examined over multiple passes, then the input has to be received as a materi-alized relation. This becomes tantamount to the Open () method doing most of the work and the benefit of pipelining not being fully achieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some physical opera-tors may not lend themselves to the iterator interface concept and hence may not support pipelining. The iterator concept may also be applied to access methods. Accessing a B +-tree or a hash-based index may be regarded as a function that can be implemented as an iterator; it produces as output a series of tuples that meet the selection condition passed to the Open() method.\n",

      "18.8 Parallel Algorithms for Query Processing   In Chapter 2, we mentioned several variations of the client/server architectures, including two-tier and three-tier architectures. There is another type of architec-ture, called parallel database architecture , that is prevalent for data-intensive applications. We will discuss it in further detail in Chapter 23 in conjunction with distributed databases and the big data and NOSQL emerging technologies. Three main approaches have been proposed for parallel databases.\n",
      "\n",
      "They corre- spond to three different hardware configurations of processors and secondary stor-age devices (disks) to support parallelism. In shared-memory architecture , multiple processors are attached to an interconnection network and can access a common main memory region. Each processor has access to the entire memory address space from all machines. The memory access to local memory and local cache is faster; memory access to the common memory is slower. This architecture suffers from interference because as more processors are added, there is increasing contention for the common memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second type of architecture is known as shared-disk architecture . In this architecture, every processor has its own mem- ory, which is not accessible from other processors. However, every machine has access to all disks through the interconnection network. Every processor may not necessarily have a disk of its own. We discussed two forms of enterprise-level sec-ondary storage systems in Section 16.11. Both storage area networks (SANs) and network attached storage (NAS) fall into the shared-disk architecture and lend themselves to parallel processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "They have different units of data transfer; SANs transfer data in units of blocks or pages to and from disks to processors; NAS behaves like a file server that transfers files using some file transfer protocol. In these systems, as more processors are added, there is more contention for the lim-ited network bandwidth.684 Chapter 18 Strategies for Query Processing The above difficulties have led to shared-nothing architecture  becoming the most commonly used architecture in parallel database systems. In this architecture, each processor accesses its own main memory and disk storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a processor A requests data located on the disk D B attached to processor B, processor A sends the request as a message over a network to processor B, which accesses its own disk DB and ships the data over the network in a message to processor A. Parallel databases using shared-nothing architecture are relatively inexpensive to build. Today, com-modity processors are being connected in this fashion on a rack, and several racks can be connected by an external network. Each processor has its own memory and disk storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shared-nothing architecture affords the possibility of achieving parallelism in query processing at three levels, which we will discuss below: individual operator parallelism, intraquery parallelism, and interquery parallelism. Studies have shown that by allocating more processors and disks, linear speed-up —a linear reduction in the time taken for operations—is possible. Linear scale-up , on the other hand, refers to being able to give a constant sustained performance by increasing the number of processors and disks proportional to the size of data. Both of these are implicit goals of parallel processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "18.8.1 Operator-Level Parallelism In the operations that can be implemented with parallel algorithms, one of the main strategies is to partition data across disks. Horizontal partitioning  of a relation corresponds to distributing the tuples across disks based on some partitioning method. Given n disks, assigning the ith tuple to disk i mod n is called round-robin partitioning . Under range partitioning , tuples are equally distributed (as much as possible) by dividing the range of values of some attribute.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, employee tuples from the EMPLOYEE relation may be assigned to 10 disks by dividing the age range into 10 ranges—say 22–25, 26–28, 29–30, and so on—such that each has roughly one-tenth of the total number of employees. Range partitioning is a chal- lenging operation and requires a good understanding of the distribution of data along the attribute involved in the range clause. The ranges used for partitioning are represented by the range vector .\n",
      "\n",
      "With hash partitioning , tuple i is assigned to the disk h(i), where h is the hashing function. Next, we briefly discuss how parallel algorithms are designed for various individual operations. Sorting. If the data has been range partitioned on an attribute—say, age—into n disks on n processors, then to sort the entire relation on age, each partition can be sorted separately in parallel and the results can be concatenated. This potentially causes close to an n-fold reduction in the overall sorting time.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the relation has been partitioned using another scheme, the following approaches are possible: ■Repartition the relation by using range partitioning on the same attribute that is the target for sorting; then sort each partition individually followed by concatenation, as mentioned above. ■Use a parallel version of the external sort-merge algorithm shown in Figure 18.2. 18.8 Parallel Algorithms for Query Processing  685 Selection.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a selection based on some condition, if the condition is an equality condition, < A = v> and the same attribute A has been used for range partitioning, the selection can be performed on only that partition to which the value v belongs. In other cases, the selection would be performed in parallel on all the processors and the results merged. If the selection condition is v1 ≤ A ≤ v2 and attribute A is used for range par- titioning, then the range of values ( v1, v2) must overlap a certain number of partitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The selection operation needs to be performed only in those processors in parallel. Projection and Duplicate Elimination. Projection without duplicate elimination can be achieved by performing the operation in parallel as data is read from each partition. Duplicate elimination can be achieved by sorting the tuples and discard-ing duplicates. For sorting, any of the techniques mentioned above can be used based on how the data is partitioned. Join.\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic idea of parallel join is to split the relations to be joined, say R and S, in such a way that the join is divided into multiple n smaller joins, and then perform these smaller joins in parallel on n processors and take a union of the result. Next, we discuss the various techniques involved to achieve this.\n",
      "\n",
      "a. Equality-based partitioned join:  If both the relations R and S are parti- tioned into n partitions on n processors such that partition ri and parti- tion si are both assigned to the same processor Pi, then the join can be computed locally provided the join is an equality join or natural join. Note that the partitions must be non-overlapping on the join key; in that sense, the partitioning is a strict set-theoretic partitioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the attribute used in the join condition must also satisfy these conditions: /box4It is the same as that used for range partitioning, and the ranges used for each partition are also the same for both R and S. Or, /box4It is the same as that used to partition into n partitions using hash partitioning. The same hash function must be used for R and S. If the distributions of values of the joining attribute are different in R and S, it is difficult to come up with a range vector that will uniformly distrib-ute both R and S into equal partitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ideally, the size of | r i | + | si | should be even for all partitions i. Otherwise, if there is too much data skew, then the benefits of parallel processing are not fully achieved. The local join at each processor may be performed using any of the techniques discussed for join: sort merge, nested loop, and hash join.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. Inequality join with partitioning and replication:  If the join condition is an inequality condition, involving <, ≤, >, ≥, ≠, and so on, then it is not possible to partition R and S in such a way that the ith partition of R— namely, ri— joins  the jth partition of S—namely, si only.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a join can be parallelized in two ways: /box4Asymmetric case : Partitioning a relation R using one of the partitioning schemes; replicating one of the relations (say S) to all the n partitions; and performing the join between ri and the entire S at processor Pi. This method is preferred when S is much smaller than R.686 Chapter 18 Strategies for Query Processing /box4Symmetric case : Under this general method, which is applicable to any type of join, both R and S are partitioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "R is partitioned n ways, and S is partitioned m ways. A total of m * n processors are used for the parallel join. These partitions are appropriately replicated so that pro-cessors P 0,0 thru Pn-1,m-1 (total of m * n processors) can perform the join locally. The processor Pi,j performs the join of ri with si using any of the join techniques. The system replicates the partition ri to proces- sors Pi,0, Pi,1 thru Pi,m-1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, partition si is replicated to processors P0,j, P1,j, P n-1,j. In general, partitioning with replication has a higher cost than just partitioning; thus partitioning with replication costs more in the case of an equijoin. c. Parallel partitioned hash join:  The partitioned hash join we described as algorithm J4 in Section 18.4 can be parallelized.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea is that when R and S are large relations, even if we partition each relation into n partitions equaling the number of processors, the local join at each processor can still be costly. This join proceeds as follows; assume that s is the smaller of r and s: 1. Using a hash function h1 on the join attribute, map each tuple of rela- tions r and s to one of the n processors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let ri and si be the partitions hashed to  Pi.. First,  read the s tuples at each processor on its local disk and map them to the appropriate processor using h1. 2. Within each processor  Pi, the tuples of S received in step 1 are parti- tioned using a different hash function h2 to, say, k buckets. This step is identical to the partitioning phase of the partitioned hash algorithm we described as J4 in Section 18.4. 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Read the r tuples from each local disk at each processor and map them to the appropriate processor using hashing function h1. As they are received at each processor, the processor partitions them using the same hash function h2 used in step 2 for the k buckets; this process is just as in the probing phase of algorithm J4. 4. The processor Pi executes the partitioned hash algorithm locally on the partitions ri and si using the joining phase on the k buckets (as described in algorithm J4) and produces a join result.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results from all processors P i are  independently computed and unioned to produce  the final result. Aggregation. Aggregate operations with grouping are achieved by partitioning on the grouping attribute and then computing the aggregate function locally at each processor using any of the uni-processor algorithms. Either range partitioning or hash partitioning can be used. Set Operations. For union, intersection, and set difference operations, if the argument relations R and S are partitioned using the same hash function, they can be done in parallel on each processor.\n",

      "18.8.2 Intraquery Parallelism We have discussed how each individual operation may be executed by distrib- uting the data among multiple processors and performing the operation in parallel on those processors. A query execution plan can be modeled as a graph of operations. To achieve a parallel execution of a query, one approach is to use a parallel algorithm for each operation involved in the query, with appro-priate partitioning of the data input to that operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another opportunity to parallelize comes from the evaluation of an operator tree where some of the operations may be executed in parallel because they do not depend on one another. These operations may be executed on separate processors. If the out-put of one of the operations can be generated tuple-by-tuple and fed into another operator, the result is pipelined parallelism . An operator that does not produce any output until it has consumed all its inputs is said to block the pipelining .\n",
      "\n",
      "18.8.3 Interquery Parallelism Interquery parallelism refers to the execution of multiple queries in parallel. In shared-nothing or shared-disk architectures, this is difficult to achieve. Activi-ties of locking, logging, and so on among processors (see the chapters in Part 9 on Transaction Processing) must be coordinated, and simultaneous conflicting updates of the same data by multiple processors must be avoided. There must be cache coherency , which guarantees that the processor updating a page has the latest version of that page in the buffer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cache-coherency and concurrency control protocols (see Chapter 21) must work in coordination as well. The main goal behind interquery parallelism is to scale up (i.e., to increase the overall rate at which queries or transactions can be processed by increasing the number of processors). Because single-processor multiuser systems themselves are designed to support concurrency control among transactions with the goal of increasing transaction throughput (see Chapter 21), database systems using shared memory parallel architecture can achieve this type of parallelism more easily without significant changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the above discussion it is clear that we can speed up the query execution by performing various operations, such as sorting, selection, projection, join, and aggregate operations, individually using their parallel execution. We may achieve further speed-up by executing parts of the query tree that are independent in parallel on different processors. However, it is difficult to achieve interquery parallelism in shared-nothing parallel architectures.\n",
      "\n",
      "One area where the shared-disk architecture has an edge is that it has a more general applicability, since it, unlike the shared-nothing architecture, does not require data to be stored in a partitioned manner. Current SAN- and NAS-based systems afford this advan-tage. A number of parameters—such as available number of processors and available buffer space—play a role in determining the overall speed-up. A detailed discussion of the effect of these parameters is outside our scope.688 Chapter 18 Strategies for Query Processing\n",

      "18.9 Summary   In this chapter, we gave an overview of the techniques used by DBMSs in processing high-level queries. We first discussed how SQL queries are translated into relational algebra. We introduced the operations of semi-join and anti-join, to which certain nested queries are mapped to avoid doing the regular inner join. We discussed exter-nal sorting, which is commonly needed during query processing to order the tuples of a relation while dealing with aggregation, duplicate elimination, and so forth.\n",

The idea of selectivity of conditions and the typi-cal information placed in a DBMS catalog was discussed.\n",

      "Then we considered the join operation in detail and proposed algorithms called nested-loop join, index-based nested-loop join, sort-merge join, and hash join. We gave illustrations of how buffer space, join selection factor, and inner–outer rela- tion choice affect the performance of the join algorithms. We also discussed the hybrid hash algorithm, which avoids some of the cost of writing during the joining phase. We discussed algorithms for projection and set operations as well as algorithms for aggre-gation.\n",

We also discussed how operations can be combined during query processing to create pipelined or stream-based execution instead of materialized execution. We introduced how operators may be implemented using the iterator concept. We ended the discussion of query processing strategies with a quick introduction to the three types of parallel database system architectures. Then we briefly summarized how parallelism can be achieved at the individual operations level and discussed intraquery and interquery parallelism as well.\n",

      " In this section, we discuss optimization techniques that apply heuristic rules to modify the internal representation of a query—which is usually in the form of a query tree or a query graph data structure—to improve its expected performance. The scanner and parser of an SQL query first generate a data structure that corresponds to an initial query representation,  which is then optimized according to heuristic rules. This leads to an optimized query representation , which corresponds to the query execution strat- egy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following that, a query execution plan is generated to execute groups of opera-tions based on the access paths available on the files involved in the query. One of the main heuristic rules  is to apply SELECT  and PROJECT  operations before applying the JOIN  or other binary operations, because the size of the file resulting from a binary operation—such as JOIN —is usually a multiplicative function of the sizes of the input files. The SELECT  and PROJECT  operations reduce the size of a file and hence should be applied before  a join or other binary operation.\n",

With materialized evaluation , the result of an operation is stored as a temporary relation (that is, the result is physically materialized ). For instance, the JOIN  opera- tion can be computed and the entire result stored as a temporary relation, which is then read as input by the algorithm that computes the PROJECT  operation, which 702 Chapter 19 Query Optimization would produce the query result table.\n",

We discussed pipelining as a strategy for query processing in Section 18.7. For example, as the selected tuples from DEPARTMENT  are produced by the SELECT  operation, they are placed in a buffer; the JOIN  operation algorithm then consumes the tuples from the buffer, and those tuples that result from the JOIN  operation are pipelined to the projection operation algorithm.\n",

Thus the total number of join order candidates is limited to 4. Also, index-based join on E, V is precluded since there is no index on V on the join column Dno.\n",

In general, views containing select-project-join operations are considered simple views and they can always be subjected to this type of view-merging.

Using materialized views to avoid some of the computation involved in a query is another query optimiza-tion technique. A materialized view may be stored temporarily to allow more queries to be processed against it or permanently, as is common in data ware-houses (see Chapter 29).\n",

The main idea behind materialization is that it is much cheaper to read it when needed and query against it than to recompute it from scratch. The savings can be significant when the view involves costly operations like join, aggregation, and so forth. Consider, for example, view V2 in Section 7.3, which defines the view as a relation by joining the DEPARTMENT and EMPLOYEE relations.\n",

Therefore, an involved algorithm is needed to replace only the relevant fragments of the query with one or more materialized views and compute the rest of the query in a conven-tional way.\n",

      "For example, deleting an employee from the database, or changing the salary of an employee, or hiring a new employee affects the tuple corre-sponding to that department in the view and hence would require the view V2 in Section 7.3 to be immediately updated. These updates are handled sometimes manu-ally by programs that update all views defined on top of a base relation whenever the base relation is updated. But there is obviously no guarantee that all views may be accounted for.\n",

      "Triggers (see Section 7.2) that are activated upon an update to the base relation may be used to take action and make appropriate changes to the materialized views.

The incremental change to the view can be computed as vnew = r  s ∪ ri  s. Similarly, deleting a set of tuples rd from r results in the new view as vnew = r  s − rd  s. We will have similar expressions symmetrically when s undergoes addition or deletion.\n",

For this approach to work, accurate cost estimates  are required so that different strategies can be compared fairly and realistically.\n",

For interpreted queries , where the entire process shown in Figure 18.1 occurs at runtime, a full- scale optimization may slow down the response time.\n",

This approach is generally referred to as cost-based query optimization . 6 It uses traditional optimization techniques that search the solution space  to a problem for a solution that minimizes an objective (cost) function. The cost functions used in query optimization are estimates and not exact cost functions, so the optimization may select a query execution strategy that is not the optimal (absolute best) one.\n",

      "19.3.1 Cost Components for Query Execution The cost of executing a query includes the following components: 1. Access cost to secondary storage. This is the cost of transferring (reading and writing) data blocks between secondary disk storage and main mem-ory buffers. This is also known as disk I/O (input/output) cost . The cost of searching for records in a disk file depends on the type of access struc-tures on that file, such as ordering, hashing, and primary or secondary indexes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, factors such as whether the file blocks are allocated contiguously on the same disk cylinder or scattered on the disk affect the access cost. 2. Disk storage cost. This is the cost of storing on disk any intermediate files that are generated by an execution strategy for the query. 3. Computation cost. This is the cost of performing in-memory operations on the records within the data buffers during query execution. Such operations include searching for and sorting records, merging records for a join or a sort operation, and performing computations on field values.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is also known as CPU (central processing unit) cost . 4. Memory usage cost. This is the cost pertaining to the number of main memory buffers needed during query execution. 5. Communication cost. This is the cost of shipping the query and its results from the database site to the site or terminal where the query originated. In distributed databases (see Chapter 23), it would also include the cost of transferring tables and results among various computers during query evaluation. 7We do not discuss global optimization in this sense in the present chapter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Details may be found in Ahmed et al. (2006).712 Chapter 19 Query Optimization For large databases, the main emphasis is often on minimizing the access cost to secondary storage. Simple cost functions ignore other factors and compare dif-ferent query execution strategies in terms of the number of block transfers between disk and main memory buffers. For smaller databases, where most of the data in the files involved in the query can be completely stored in memory, the emphasis is on minimizing computation cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "In distributed databases, where many sites are involved (see Chapter 23), communication cost must be minimized. It is difficult to include all the cost components in a (weighted) cost function because of the difficulty of assigning suitable weights to the cost com-ponents. This is why some cost functions consider a single factor only—disk access. In the next section, we discuss some of the information that is needed for formulating cost functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "19.3.2 Catalog Information Used in Cost Functions To estimate the costs of various execution strategies, we must keep track of any information that is needed for the cost functions. This information may be stored in the DBMS catalog, where it is accessed by the query optimizer. First, we must know the size of each file. For a file whose records are all of the same type, the  number of records (tuples) ( r), the (average) record size ( R), and the number of file blocks ( b) (or close estimates of them) are needed.\n",

      "The blocking factor ( bfr) for the file may also be needed. These were mentioned in Section 18.3.4, and we utilized them while illustrating the various implementation algorithms for relational opera-tions. We must also keep track of the primary file organization  for each file. The primary file organization records may be unordered , ordered  by an attribute with or without a primary or clustering index, or hashed  (static hashing or one of the dynamic hashing methods) on a key attribute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Information is also kept on all pri-mary, secondary, or clustering indexes and their indexing attributes. The number of levels ( x) of each multilevel index (primary, secondary, or clustering) is needed for cost functions that estimate the number of block accesses that occur during query execution. In some cost functions the number of first-level index blocks (b I1) is needed.\n",

      "Another important parameter is the number of distinct values NDV (A, R)  of an attribute in relation R and the attribute selectivity ( sl), which is the fraction of records satisfying an equality condition on the attribute. This allows estimation of the selection cardinality ( s = sl*r) of an attribute, which is the average  number of records that will satisfy an equality selection condition on that attribute. Information such as the number of index levels is easy to maintain because it does not change very often.\n",
      "\n",

The query optimizer will need reasonably close but not necessarily com- pletely up-to-the-minute values of these parameters for use in estimating the cost of various execution strategies. To help with estimating the size of the results of que-ries, it is important to have as good an estimate of the distribution of values as pos-sible. To that end, most systems store a histogram.\n",

It is customary for most RDBMSs to store histograms for most of the important attributes. Without a histogram, the best assumption is that values of an attribute are uniformly distributed over its range from high to low. Histograms divide the attribute over important ranges (called buckets) and store the total number of records that belong to that bucket in that relation.\n",

An implicit assumption is made sometimes that among the distinct values within a bucket there is a uniform distribution. All these assumptions are oversimplifications that rarely hold. So keeping a histogram with a finer granularity (i.e., larger number of buckets) is always useful. A couple of variations of histo-grams are common: in equi-width  histograms, the range of values is divided into equal subranges.\n",

      "19.7.3 Plan Caching In Chapter 2, we referred to parametric users who run the same queries or transac-tions repeatedly, but each time with a different set of parameters. For example, a bank teller uses an account number and some function code to check the balance in that account. To run such queries or transactions repeatedly, the query optimizer computes the best plan when the query is submitted for the first time and caches the plan for future use. This storing of the plan and reusing it is referred to as plan caching .\n",
      "\n",
      "When the query is resubmitted with different constants as parameters, the same plan is reused with the new parameters. It is conceivable that the plan may need to be modified under certain situations; for example, if the query involves report generation over a range of dates or range of accounts, then, depending on the amount of data involved, different strategies may apply. Under a variation called parametric query optimization , a query is optimized without a certain set of values for its parameters and the optimizer outputs a number of plans for different possible value sets, all of which are cached.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "19.7.4 Top- k Results Optimization When the output of a query is expected to be large, sometimes the user is satisfied with only the top- k results based on some sort order. Some RDBMSs have a limit  K clause  to limit the result to that size. Similarly, hints may be specified to inform the optimizer to limit the generation of the result. Trying to generate the entire result and then presenting only the top- k results by sorting is a naive and inefficient strat- egy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the suggested strategies, one uses generation of results in a sorted order so that it can be stopped after K tuples. Other strategies, such as introducing addi- tional selection conditions based on the estimated highest value, have been pro-posed. Details are beyond our scope here.

      "19.8  An Example of Query Optimization   in Data Warehouses In this section, we introduce another example of query transformation and rewrit- ing as a technique for query optimization. In Section 19.2, we saw examples of query transformation and rewriting. Those examples dealt with nested subqueries and used heuristics rather than cost-based optimization. The subquery (view) merging example we showed can be considered a heuristic transformation; but the group-by view merging uses cost-based optimization as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this section, we consider a transformation of star-schema queries in data warehouses based on cost considerations. These queries are commonly used in data warehouse applications that follow the star schema. (See Section 29.3 for a discussion of star schemas.) We will refer to this procedure as s tar-transformation optimization . The star schema contains a collection of tables; it gets its name because of the schema’s resemblance to a star-like shape whose center contains one or more fact tables (relations) that reference multiple dimension tables (relations).\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact table con-tains information about the relationships (e.g., sales) among the various dimension tables (e.g., customer, part, supplier, channel, year, etc.) and measure columns (e.g., amount_sold, etc.). Consider the representative query called QSTAR given below. Assume that D1, D2, D3 are aliases for the dimension tables DIM1, DIM2, DIM3, whose primary keys are, respectively, D1.Pk, D2.Pk, and D3.Pk .\n",
      "\n",
      "These dimensions have corresponding foreign key attributes in the fact table FACT with alias F—namely, F.Fk1, F.Fk2, F.Fk3—on which joins can be defined.\n",
      "\n",
      "The query creates a grouping on attributes D1.X, D2.Y and produces a sum of the so-called “measure” attribute (see Section 29.3) F.M from the fact table F. There are conditions on attri-butes A, B, C in DIM1, DIM2, DIM3, respectively: Query QSTAR: SELECT  D1.X, D2.Y, SUM (F.M) FROM  FACT F, DIM1 D1, DIM2 D2, DIM3 D3 WHERE  F.Fk1 = D1.Pk and F.Fk2 = D2.Pk and F.Fk3 = D3.Pk and D1.A > 5 and D2.B < 77 and D3.C = 11 GROUP BY  D1.X, D2.Y The fact table is generally very large in comparison with the dimension tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "QSTAR is a typical star query, and its fact table tends to be generally very large and joined with several tables of small dimension tables. The query may also contain single-table filter predicates on other columns of the dimension tables, which are generally restrictive. The combination of these filters helps to significantly reduce the data set processed from the fact table (such as D1.A > 5 in the above query). This type of query generally does grouping on columns coming from dimension tables and aggregation on measure columns coming from the fact table.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of star-transformation optimization is to access only this reduced set of data from the fact table and avoid using a full table scan on it. Two types of star- transformation optimizations are possible: (A) classic star transformation, and  732 Chapter 19 Query Optimization (B) bitmap index star transformation. Both these optimizations are performed on the basis of comparative costs of the original and the transformed queries. A.\n",

The result of this Cartesian product is then joined with the fact table using B-tree indexes (if any) on the joining keys of the fact table. B. Bitmap Index Star Transformation The requirement with this optimization is that there must be bitmap 17 indexes on the fact-table joining keys referenced in the query.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in QSTAR, there must be bitmap indexes (see Section 17.5.2) on FACT.Fk1, FACT.Fk2, and FACT.Fk3 attributes; each bit in the bitmap corresponds to a row in the fact table. The bit is set if the key value of the attribute appears in a row of the fact table. The given query QSTAR is transformed into Q2STAR as shown below.\n",

      "\n",
      "Note that the subqueries introduced in Q2STAR may be looked upon as a set membership operation; for example, F.Fk1 IN (5, 9, 12, 13, 29 …). When driven by bitmap AND and OR operations of the key values supplied by the dimension subqueries, only the relevant rows from the fact table need to be retrieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the filter predicates on the dimension tables and the intersection of the fact table joining each dimension table filtered out a significant subset of the fact table rows, then this optimization would prove to be much more efficient than a brute force full-table scan of the fact table. 17In some cases, the B-tree index keys can be converted into bitmaps, but we will not discuss this technique here. 19.9 Overview of Query Optimization in Oracle  733 The following operations are performed in Q2STAR in order to access and join the FACT table.\n",

      "1. By iterating over the key values coming from a dimension subquery, the bitmaps are retrieved for a given key value from a bitmap index on the FACT table. 2. For a subquery, the bitmaps retrieved for various key values are merged (OR-ed). 3. The merged bitmaps for each dimension subqueries are AND-ed; that is, a conjunction of the joins is performed. 4. From the final bitmap, the corresponding tuple-ids for the FACT table are generated. 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FACT table rows are directly retrieved using the tuple-ids. Joining Back:  The subquery bitmap trees filter the fact table based on the filter predicates on the dimension tables; therefore, it may still be necessary to join the dimension tables back to the relevant rows in the fact table using the original join predicates. The join back of a dimension table can be avoided if the column(s) selected from the subquery are unique and the columns of the dimension table are not referenced in the SELECT and GROUP-BY clauses.\n",

      "\n",
      "19.9.1 Physical Optimizer The Oracle physical optimizer is cost based and was introduced in Oracle 7.1. The scope of the physical optimizer is a single query block. The physical optimizer examines alternative table and index access paths, operator algorithms, join order-ings, join methods, parallel execution distribution methods, and so on. It chooses the execution plan with the lowest estimated cost. The estimated query cost is a relative number proportional to the expected elapsed time needed to execute the query with the given execution plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The physical optimizer calculates this cost based on object statistics (such as table cardinalities, number of distinct values in a column, column high and low values, data distribution of column values), the estimated usage of resources (such as I/O and CPU time), and memory needed. Its estimated cost is an internal metric that 18This section is contributed by Rafi Ahmed of Oracle Corporation. 19Support for analytics was introduced in Oracle 10.2.734 Chapter 19 Query Optimization roughly corresponds to the run time and the required resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of cost- based optimization in Oracle is to find the best trade-off between the lowest run time and the least resource utilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "19.9.2 Global Query Optimizer In traditional RDBMSs, query optimization consists of two distinct logical and physical optimization phases. In contrast, Oracle has a global query optimizer, where logical transformation and physical optimization phases have been inte-grated to generate an optimal execution plan for the entire query tree. The architec-ture of the Oracle query processing is illustrated in Figure 19.7. Oracle performs a multitude of query transformations, which change and trans- form the user queries into equivalent but potentially more optimal forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transfor-mations can be either heuristic-based or cost-based. The cost-based query transformation (CBQT) framework 20 introduced in Oracle 10g provides efficient mechanisms for exploring the state space generated by applying one or more trans-formations. During cost-based transformation, an SQL statement, which may com-prise multiple query blocks, is copied and transformed and its cost is computed using the physical optimizer.\n",
      "\n",
      "This process is repeated multiple times, each time applying a new set of possibly interdependent transformations; and, at the end, one or more transformations are selected and applied to the original SQL statement, if those transformations result in an optimal execution plan. To deal with the combi- natorial explosion, the CBQT framework provides efficient strategies for searching the state space of various transformations. The availability of the general framework for cost-based transformation has made it possible for other innovative transformations to be added to the vast repertoire of 20As presented in Ahmed et al.\n",

      "\n",
      "Major among these transformations are group-by and distinct subquery merging (in the FROM clause of the query), sub-query unnesting, predicate move-around, common subexpression elimination, join predicate push down, OR expansion, subquery coalescing, join factorization,  subquery removal through window function, star transformation, group-by placement, and bushy join trees. 21 The cost-based transformation framework of Oracle 10g is a good example of the sophisticated approach taken to optimize SQL queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "19.9.3 Adaptive Optimization Oracle’s physical optimizer is adaptive and uses a feedback loop from the execu-tion level to improve on its previous decisions. The optimizer selects the most optimal execution plan for a given SQL statement using the cost model, which relies on object statistics (e.g., number of rows, distribution of column values, etc.) and system statistics (e.g., I/O bandwidth of the storage subsystem).\n",
      "\n",
      "The optimality of the final execution plan depends primarily on the accuracy of the statistics fed into the cost model as well as on the sophistication of the cost model itself. In Oracle, the feedback loop shown in Figure 19.7 establishes a bridge between the execution engine and the physical optimizer. The bridge brings valuable statistical information to enable the physical optimizer to assess the impact of its decisions and make better decisions for the current and future exe-cutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, based on the estimated value of table cardinality, the opti-mizer may choose the index-based nested-loop join method. However, during the execution phase, the actual table cardinality may be detected to diverge sig-nificantly from the estimated value. This information may trigger the physical optimizer to revise its decision and dynamically change the index access join method to the hash join method.\n",
      "\n",
      "19.9.4 Array Processing One of the critical deficiencies of SQL implementations is its lack of support for N-dimensional array-based computation. Oracle has made extensions for analyt- ics and OLAP features; these extensions have been integrated into the Oracle RDBMS engine. 22 We will illustrate the need for OLAP queries when we discuss data warehousing in Chapter 29. These SQL extensions involving array-based computations for complex modeling and optimizations include access structures and execution strategies for processing these computations efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "The com- putation clause (details are beyond our scope here) allows the Oracle RDBMS to treat a table as a multidimensional array and specify a set of formulas over it. The formulas replace multiple joins and UNION operations that must be performed for equivalent computation with current ANSI SQL (where ANSI stands for 21More details can be found in Ahmed et al.

      "\n",
      "19.9.5 Hints An interesting addition to the Oracle query optimizer is the capability for an applica-tion developer to specify hints (also called query annotations  or directives  in other systems) to the optimizer. Hints are embedded in the text of an SQL statement. Hints are commonly used to address the infrequent cases where the optimizer chooses a suboptimal plan. The idea is that an application developer occasionally might need to override the optimizer decisions based on cost or cardinality mis-estimations.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, consider the EMPLOYEE  table shown in Figure 5.6. The Sex column of that table has only two distinct values. If there are 10,000 employees, then the optimizer, in the absence of a histogram on the Sex column, would estimate that half are male and half are female, assuming a uniform data distribution. If a secondary index exists, it would more than likely not be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if the application developer knows that there are only 100 male employees, a hint could be specified in an SQL query whose WHERE -clause condition is Sex = ‘M’ so that the associated index would be used in processing the query. Various types of hints can be specified for different operations; these hints include but are not limited to the following: ■The access path for a given table ■The join order for a query block ■A particular join method for a join between tables ■The enabling or disabling of a transformation\n",
      "\n",
      "19.9.6 Outlines In Oracle RDBMSs, outlines are used to preserve execution plans of SQL state- ments or queries. Outlines are implemented and expressed as a collection of hints, because hints are easily portable and comprehensible. Oracle provides an extensive set of hints that are powerful enough to specify any execution plan, no matter how complex. When an outline is used during the optimization of an SQL statement, these hints are applied at appropriate stages by the optimizer (and other components).\n",
      "\n",
      "Every SQL statement processed by the Oracle optimizer automatically generates an outline that can be displayed with the execution plan. Outlines are used for purposes such as plan stability, what-if analysis, and perfor-mance experiments.\n",

      "19.9.7 SQL Plan Management Execution plans for SQL statements have a significant impact on the overall perfor-mance of a database system. New optimizer statistics, configuration parameter changes, software updates, introduction of new query optimization and processing techniques, and hardware resource utilizations are among a multitude of factors  19.10 Semantic Query Optimization  737 that may cause the Oracle query optimizer to generate a new execution plan for the same SQL queries or statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although most of the changes in the execution plans are beneficial or benign, a few execution plans may turn out to be suboptimal, which can have a negative impact on system performance. In Oracle 11g, a novel feature called SQL plan management (SPM) was introduced 23 for managing execution plans for a set of queries or workloads. SPM provides stable and optimal performance for a set of SQL statements by preventing new subopti-mal plans from being executed while allowing other new plans to be executed if they are verifiably better than the previous plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "SPM encapsulates an elaborate mechanism for managing the execution plans of a set of SQL statements, for which the user has enabled SPM. SPM maintains the previous execution plans in the form of stored outlines associated with texts of SQL statements and compares the perfor-mances of the old and new execution plans for a given SQL statement before per-mitting them to be used by the user. SPM can be configured to work automatically, or it can be manually controlled for one or more SQL statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "19.10 Semantic Query Optimization   A different approach to query optimization, called semantic query optimization , has been suggested. This technique, which may be used in combination with the techniques discussed previously, uses constraints specified on the database schema— such as unique attributes and other more complex constraints—to modify one query into another query that is more efficient to execute. We will not discuss this approach in detail but we will illustrate it with a simple example.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider the SQL query: SELECT  E.Lname, M.Lname FROM  EMPLOYEE AS E, EMPLOYEE AS M WHERE  E.Super_ssn=M.Ssn AND  E.Salary > M.Salary This query retrieves the names of employees who earn more than their supervisors. Suppose that we had a constraint on the database schema that stated that no employee can earn more than his or her direct supervisor.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the semantic query optimizer checks for the existence of this constraint, it does not need to execute the query because it knows that the result of the query will be empty. This may save considerable time if the constraint checking can be done efficiently. However, searching through many constraints to find those that are applicable to a given query and that may semantically optimize it can also be time-consuming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider another example: SELECT Lname, Salary FROM EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENTWHERE EMPLOYEE.Dno = DEPARTMENT.Dnumber and EMPLOYEE.Salary >100000 23See Ziauddin et al. (2008).738 Chapter 19 Query Optimization In this example, the attributes retrieved are only from one relation: EMPLOYEE; the selection condition is also on that one relation.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there is a referential integ-rity constraint that Employee.Dno is a foreign key that refers to the primary key Department.Dnumber.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, this query can be transformed by removing the DEPARTMENT relation from the query and thus avoiding the inner join as follows: SELECT Lname, Salary FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE EMPLOYEE.Dno IS NOT NULL and EMPLOYEE.Salary >100000 This type of transformation is based on the primary-key/foreign-key relationship semantics, which are a constraint between the two relations.\n",

      "In Section 19.1 we introduced the nota-tion for query trees and graphs and described heuristic approaches to query optimization; these approaches use heuristic rules and algebraic techniques to improve the efficiency of query execution. We showed how a query tree that repre-sents a relational algebra expression can be heuristically optimized by reorganizing the tree nodes and transforming the tree into another equivalent query tree that is more efficient to execute. We also gave equivalence-preserving transformation rules and a systematic procedure for applying them to a query tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Section 19.2 we described alternative query evaluation plans, including pipelining and material- ized evaluation. Then we introduced the notion of query transformation of SQL queries; this transformation optimizes nested subqueries. We also illustrated with examples of merging subqueries occurring in the FROM clause, which act as derived relations or views. We also discussed the technique of materializing views. We discussed in some detail the cost-based approach to query optimization in Section 19.3. We discussed information maintained in catalogs that the query optimizer consults.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also discussed histograms to maintain distribution of important attributes. We showed how cost functions are developed for some database access algorithms for selection and join in Sections 19.4 and 19.5, respec-tively. We illustrated with an example in Section 19.6 how these cost functions are used to estimate the costs of different execution strategies. A number of addi-tional issues such as display of query plans, size estimation of results, plan cach-ing and top-k results optimization were discussed in Section 19.7.\n",

      "In this section, we discuss the concepts of concurrent execution of transactions and recovery from transaction failures. Section 20.1.1 compares single-user and multi-user database systems and demonstrates how concurrent execution of transactions can take place in multiuser systems. Section 20.1.2 defines the concept of transac-tion and presents a simple model of transaction execution based on read and write database operations. This model is used as the basis for defining and formalizing concurrency control and recovery concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 20.1.3 uses informal examples to show why concurrency control techniques are needed in multiuser systems. Finally, Section 20.1.4 discusses why techniques are needed to handle recovery from system and transaction failures by discussing the different ways in which transactions can fail while executing.\n",
      "\n",
      "20.1.1 Single-User versus Multiuser Systems One criterion for classifying a database system is according to the number of users who can use the system concurrently . A DBMS is single-user  if at most one user at a time can use the system, and it is multiuser  if many users can use the system— and hence access the database—concurrently. Single-user DBMSs are mostly restricted to personal computer systems; most other DBMSs are multiuser.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, an airline reservations system is used by hundreds of users and travel agents concurrently. Database systems used in banks, insurance agencies, stock exchanges, supermarkets, and many other applications are multiuser systems. In these systems, hundreds or thousands of users are typically operating on the data-base by submitting transactions concurrently to the system. Multiple users can access databases—and use computer systems—simultaneously because of the concept of multiprogramming , which allows the operating system of the computer to execute multiple programs—or processes —at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "A single  20.1 Introduction to Transaction Processing  747 central processing unit (CPU) can only execute at most one process at a time. How- ever, multiprogramming operating systems  execute some commands from one pro- cess, then suspend that process and execute some commands from the next process, and so on. A process is resumed at the point where it was suspended whenever it gets its turn to use the CPU again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, concurrent execution of processes is actually interleaved , as illustrated in Figure 20.1, which shows two processes, A and B, execut- ing concurrently in an interleaved fashion. Interleaving keeps the CPU busy when a process requires an input or output (I/O) operation, such as reading a block from disk. The CPU is switched to execute another process rather than remaining idle during I/O time. Interleaving also prevents a long process from delaying other processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the computer system has multiple hardware processors (CPUs), parallel processing of multiple processes is possible, as illustrated by processes C and D in Figure 20.1. Most of the theory concerning concurrency control in databases is developed in terms of interleaved concurrency , so for the remainder of this chapter we assume this model. In a multiuser DBMS, the stored data items are the primary resources that may be accessed concurrently by interactive users or application programs, which are con-stantly retrieving information from and modifying the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "20.1.2  Transactions, Database Items, Read and Write Operations, and DBMS Buffers A transaction  is an executing program that forms a logical unit of database pro- cessing. A transaction includes one or more database access operations—these can include insertion, deletion, modification (update), or retrieval operations. The database operations that form a transaction can either be embedded within an application program or they can be specified interactively via a high-level query language such as SQL.\n",
      "\n",
      "One way of specifying the transaction boundaries is by specifying explicit begin transaction  and end transaction  statements in an appli- cation program; in this case, all database access operations between the two are considered as forming one transaction. A single application program may contain more than one transaction if it contains several transaction boundaries.\n",

      "\n",
      "The database model  that is used to present transaction processing concepts is sim- ple when compared to the data models that we discussed earlier in the book, such as the relational model or the object model. A database  is basically represented as a collection of named data items. The size of a data item is called its granularity . A data item  can be a database record , but it can also be a larger unit such as a whole disk block , or even a smaller unit such as an individual field (attribute) value  of some record in the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "The transaction processing concepts we discuss are independent of the data item granularity (size) and apply to data items in general. Each data item has a unique name , but this name is not typically used by the pro- grammer; rather, it is just a means to uniquely identify each data item . For example, if the data item granularity is one disk block, then the disk block address can be used as the data item name. If the item granularity is a single record, then the record id can be the item name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using this simplified database model, the basic database access operations that a transaction can include are as follows: ■read_item( X). Reads a database item named X into a program variable. To simplify our notation, we assume that the program variable is also named X. ■write_item( X). Writes the value of program variable X into the database item named X. As we discussed in Chapter 16, the basic unit of data transfer from disk to main memory is one disk page (disk block).\n",
      "\n",
      "Executing a read_item (X) command includes the following steps: 1. Find the address of the disk block that contains item X. 2. Copy that disk block into a buffer in main memory (if that disk block is not already in some main memory buffer). The size of the buffer is the same as the disk block size. 3. Copy item X from the buffer to the program variable named X. Executing a write_item (X) command includes the following steps: 1. Find the address of the disk block that contains item X. 2.\n",

Copy item X from the program variable named X into its correct location in the buffer. 4. Store the updated disk block from the buffer back to disk (either immedi-ately or at some later point in time). It is step 4 that actually updates the database on disk. Sometimes the buffer is not immediately stored to disk, in case additional changes are to be made to the buffer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually, the decision about when to store a modified disk block whose contents are in a main memory buffer is handled by the recovery manager of the DBMS in cooperation with the underlying operating system. The DBMS will maintain in the database cache   20.1 Introduction to Transaction Processing  749 a number of data buffers  in main memory. Each buffer typically holds the contents of one database disk block, which contains some of the database items being pro-cessed.\n",

      "When these buffers are all occupied, and additional database disk blocks must be copied into memory, some buffer replacement policy  is used to choose which of the current occupied buffers is to be replaced. Some commonly used buffer replacement policies are LRU  (least recently used). If the chosen buffer has been modified, it must be written back to disk before it is reused. 1 There are also buffer replacement policies that are specific to DBMS characteristics. We briefly discuss a few of these in Section 20.2.4.\n",

      "A transaction includes read_item  and write_item  operations to access and update the database. Figure 20.2 shows examples of two very simple transactions. The read-set of a transaction is the set of all items that the transaction reads, and the write-set  is the set of all items that the transaction writes. For example, the read-set of T1 in Figure 20.2 is { X, Y} and its write-set is also { X, Y}. Concurrency control and recovery mechanisms are mainly concerned with the database commands in a transaction.\n",

      "Transactions submitted by the various users may execute concurrently and may access and update the same database items. If this concurrent execution is uncontrolled , it may lead to problems, such as an inconsistent database. In the next section, we informally introduce some of the problems that may occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "20.1.3 Why Concurrency Control Is Needed Several problems can occur when concurrent transactions execute in an uncontrolled manner. We illustrate some of these problems by referring to a much simplified air- line reservations database in which a record is stored for each airline flight. Each record includes the number of reserved seats  on that flight as a named (uniquely iden- tifiable) data item , among other information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 20.2(a) shows a transaction T 1 that transfers N  reservations from one flight whose number of reserved seats is stored in the database item named X to another flight whose number of reserved seats is stored in the database item named Y. Figure 20.2(b) shows a simpler transaction T2 that just reserves M  seats on the first flight ( X) referenced in transaction T\n",
      "\n",
      "1.2 To sim-   plify our example, we do not show additional portions of the transactions, such as checking whether a flight has enough seats available before reserving additional seats. When a database access program is written, it has the flight number, the flight date, and the number of seats to be booked as parameters; hence, the same program can be used to execute many different transactions , each with a different flight number, date, and number of seats to be booked.\n",
      "\n",
      "For concurrency control purposes, a trans-action is a particular execution  of a program on a specific date, flight, and number 1We will not discuss general-purpose buffer replacement policies here because they are typically discussed in operating systems texts. 2A similar, more commonly used example assumes a bank database, with one transaction doing a transfer of funds from account X to account Y and the other transaction doing a deposit to account X.750 Chapter 20 Introduction to Transaction Processing Concepts and Theory of seats.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Figures 20.2(a) and (b), the transactions T1 and T2 are specific executions of the programs that refer to the specific flights whose numbers of seats are stored in data items X and Y in the database. Next we discuss the types of problems we may encounter with these two simple transactions if they run concurrently. The Lost Update Problem. This problem occurs when two transactions that access the same database items have their operations interleaved in a way that makes the value of some database items incorrect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose that transactions T 1 and T2 are submitted at approximately the same time, and suppose that their operations are interleaved as shown in Figure 20.3(a); then the final value of item X is incorrect because T 2 reads the value of X before T 1 changes it in the database, and hence the updated value resulting from T1 is lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if X = 80 at the start (originally there were 80 reservations on the flight), N = 5 ( T1 transfers 5 seat reservations from the flight corresponding to X to the flight corresponding to Y), and M = 4 ( T2 reserves 4 seats on X), the final result should be X = 79. However, in the interleaving of operations shown in Figure 20.3(a), it is X = 84 because the update in T1 that removed the five seats from X was lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Temporary Update (or Dirty Read) Problem. This problem occurs when one transaction updates a database item and then the transaction fails for some reason (see Section 20.1.4). Meanwhile, the updated item is accessed (read) by another transaction before it is changed back (or rolled back) to its original value. Figure 20.3(b) shows an example where T 1 updates item X and then fails before completion, so the system must roll back X to its original value.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before it can do so, however, transaction T2 reads the temporary  value of X, which will not be recorded permanently in the database because of the failure of T1. The value of item X that is read by T2 is called dirty data  because it has been created by a transaction that has not completed and committed yet; hence, this problem is also known as the dirty read problem . The Incorrect Summary Problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "If one transaction is calculating an aggregate summary function on a number of database items while other transactions are updating some of these items, the aggregate function may calculate some values before they are updated and others after they are updated. For example, suppose that a transaction T 3 is calculating the total number of reservations on all the flights; meanwhile, transaction T1 is executing.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the interleaving of operations shown in Figure 20.3(c) occurs, the result of T3 will be off by an amount N because T3 reads the value of X after N  seats have been subtracted from it but reads the value of Y before  those N seats have been added to it.\n",

      "This may occur, for example, if during an airline reservation transaction, a customer inquires about seat availability on several flights.

      "20.1.4 Why Recovery Is Needed Whenever a transaction is submitted to a DBMS for execution, the system is responsible for making sure that either all the operations in the transaction are completed successfully and their effect is recorded permanently in the database, or that the transaction does not have any effect on the database or any other transactions. In the first case, the transaction is said to be committed , whereas in the second case, the transaction is aborted .\n",
      "\n",
      "The DBMS must not permit some operations of a transaction T to be applied to the database while other opera- tions of T are not, because the whole transaction  is a logical unit of database processing. If a transaction fails  after executing some of its operations but before executing all of them, the operations already executed must be undone and have no lasting effect. Types of Failures. Failures are generally classified as transaction, system, and media failures. There are several possible reasons for a transaction to fail in the middle of execution: 1. A computer failure (system crash).\n",
      "\n",
      "A hardware, software, or network error occurs in the computer system during transaction execution. Hardware crashes are usually media failures—for example, main memory failure. 2. A transaction or system error. Some operation in the transaction may cause it to fail, such as integer overflow or division by zero. Transaction fail-ure may also occur because of erroneous parameter values or because of a logical programming error. 3 Additionally, the user may interrupt the trans- action during its execution. 3. Local errors or exception conditions detected by the transaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "During transaction execution, certain conditions may occur that necessitate cancel-lation of the transaction. For example, data for the transaction may not be found. An exception condition, 4 such as insufficient account balance in a banking database, may cause a transaction, such as a fund withdrawal, to be canceled. This exception could be programmed in the transaction itself, and in such a case would not be considered as a transaction failure. 3In general, a transaction should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it does not have any bugs (logical programming errors).\n",

      "4Exception conditions, if programmed correctly, do not constitute transaction failures. 20.2 Transaction and System Concepts  753 4. Concurrency control enforcement. The concurrency control method (see Chapter 21)may abort a transaction because it violates serializability (see Section 20.5), or it may abort one or more transactions to resolve a state of deadlock among several transactions (see Section 21.1.3).\n",
      "\n",
      "Transactions aborted because of serializability violations or deadlocks are typically restarted automatically at a later time. 5. Disk failure. Some disk blocks may lose their data because of a read or write malfunction or because of a disk read/write head crash. This may happen during a read or a write operation of the transaction. 6. Physical problems and catastrophes.\n",
      "\n",
      "This refers to an endless list of problems that includes power or air-conditioning failure, fire, theft, sabotage, overwrit-ing disks or tapes by mistake, and mounting of a wrong tape by the operator. Failures of types 1, 2, 3, and 4 are more common than those of types 5 or 6. When- ever a failure of type 1 through 4 occurs, the system must keep sufficient informa-tion to quickly recover from the failure.\n",

Section 20.2.1 describes the various states a transaction can be in and discusses other operations needed in transaction processing.

      "20.2.1 Transaction States and Additional Operations A transaction is an atomic unit of work that should either be completed in its entirety or not done at all. For recovery purposes, the system needs to keep track of when each transaction starts, terminates, and commits, or aborts (see Section 20.2.3). Therefore, the recovery manager of the DBMS needs to keep track of the following operations: ■BEGIN_TRANSACTION . This marks the beginning of transaction execution. ■READ  or WRITE .\n",
      "\n",
      "These specify read or write operations on the database items that are executed as part of a transaction. ■END_TRANSACTION . This specifies that READ  and WRITE  transaction opera- tions have ended and marks the end of transaction execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, at this point it may be necessary to check whether the changes introduced by the transaction can be permanently applied to the database (committed) or 754 Chapter 20 Introduction to Transaction Processing Concepts and Theory whether the transaction has to be aborted because it violates serializability (see Section 20.5) or for some other reason. ■COMMIT_TRANSACTION . This signals a successful end  of the transaction so that any changes (updates) executed by the transaction can be safely committed  to the database and will not be undone.\n",
      "\n",
      "■ROLLBACK  (or ABORT ). This signals that the transaction has ended unsuc- cessfully,  so that any changes or effects that the transaction may have applied to the database must be undone . Figure 20.4 shows a state transition diagram that illustrates how a transaction moves through its execution states. A transaction goes into an active state  immedi- ately after it starts execution, where it can execute its READ  and WRITE  operations. When the transaction ends, it moves to the partially committed state .\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, some types of concurrency control protocols may do additional checks to see if the transaction can be committed or not. Also, some recovery protocols need to ensure that a system failure will not result in an inability to record the changes of the transaction permanently (usually by recording changes in the system log,  discussed in the next section). 5 If these checks are successful, the transaction is said to have reached its commit point and enters the committed state . Commit points are discussed in more detail in Section 20.2.3.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a transaction is committed, it has concluded its execution successfully and all its changes must be recorded perma nently in the database, even if a system failure occurs. However, a transaction can go to the failed state  if one of the checks fails or if the trans- action is aborted during its active state. The transaction may then have to be rolled back to undo the effect of its WRITE  operations on the database. The terminated state  corre- sponds to the transaction leaving the system.\n",

      "\n",
      "Typically, one (or more) main memory buffers, called the log buffers , hold the last part of the log file, so that log entries are first added to the log main memory buffer. When the log buffer  is filled, or when certain other conditions occur, the log buffer is appended to the end of the log file on disk . In addition, the log file from disk is periodically backed up to archival storage (tape) to guard against catastrophic failures.\n",

      "The following are the types of entries—called log records —that are written to the log file and the corresponding action for each log record. In these entries, T refers to a unique transaction-id  that is generated automatically by the system for each transaction and that is used to identify each transaction: 1. [start_transaction , T]. Indicates that transaction T has started execution. 2. [write_item , T, X, old_value , new_value ].\n",

      "Additionally, some recovery protocols require simpler WRITE  entries that only include one of new_value  or old_value  instead of including both (see Sec- tion 20.4.2). Notice that we are assuming that all permanent changes to the database occur within transactions, so the notion of recovery from a transaction failure amounts to either undoing or redoing transaction operations individually from the log. If the system crashes, we can recover to a consistent database state by examining the log and using one of the techniques described in Chapter 22.\n",

      "As discussed in Chapter 16, updating a disk file involves copying the appropriate block of the file from disk to a buffer in main memory, updating the buffer in main memory, and copying the buffer to disk. As we mentioned earlier, it is common to keep one or more blocks of the log file in main memory buffers, called the log buffer , until they are filled with log entries and then to write them back to disk only once, rather than writing to disk every time a log entry is added. This saves the overhead of multiple disk writes of the same log file buffer.\n",

      "In a DBMS, various types of disk pages exist: index pages, data file pages, log file pages, and so on. In this method, the DBMS cache is divided into separate domains (sets of buffers). Each domain han-dles one type of disk pages, and page replacements within each domain are han- 7Undo and redo are discussed more fully in Chapter 22. 20.3 Desirable Properties of Transactions  757 dled via the basic LRU (least recently used) page replacement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although this achieves better performance on average that basic LRU, it is a static algorithm,  and so does not adapt to dynamically changing loads because the number of available buffers for each domain is predetermined. Several variations of the DS page replacement policy have been proposed, which add dynamic load-balancing fea-tures. For example, the GRU  (Group LRU) gives each domain a priority level and selects pages from the lowest-priority level domain first for replacement, whereas another method dynamically changes the number of buffers in each domain based on current workload.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hot Set Method. This page replacement algorithm is useful in queries that have to scan a set of pages repeatedly, such as when a join operation is performed using the nested-loop method (see Chapter 18). If the inner loop file is loaded completely into main memory buffers without replacement (the hot set), the join will be per-formed efficiently because each page in the outer loop file will have to scan all the records in the inner loop file to find join matches.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hot set method determines for each database processing algorithm the set of disk pages that will be accessed repeatedly, and it does not replace them until their processing is completed. The DBMIN Method. This page replacement policy uses a model known as QLSM (query locality set model), which predetermines the pattern of page references for each algorithm for a particular type of database operation. We discussed various algorithms for relational operations such as SELECT and JOIN in Chapter 18.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on the type of access method, the file characteristics, and the algorithm used, the QLSM will estimate the number of main memory buffers needed for each file involved in the operation. The DBMIN page replacement policy will calculate a locality set  using QLSM for each file instance involved in the query (some queries may reference the same file twice, so there would be a locality set for each file instance needed in the query). DBMIN then allocates the appropriate number of buffers to each file instance involved in the query based on the locality set for that file instance.\n",
      "\n",

      "20.3 Desirable Properties of Transactions   Transactions should possess several properties, often called the ACID  properties; they should be enforced by the concurrency control and recovery methods of the DBMS. The following are the ACID properties: ■Atomicity. A transaction is an atomic unit of processing; it should either be performed in its entirety or not performed at all. ■Consistency preservation.\n",
      "\n",
      "A transaction should be consistency preserving, meaning that if it is completely executed from beginning to end without interference from other transactions, it should take the database from one consistent state to another.758 Chapter 20 Introduction to Transaction Processing Concepts and Theory ■Isolation. A transaction should appear as though it is being executed in iso- lation from other transactions, even though many transactions are execut-ing concurrently. That is, the execution of a transaction should not be interfered with by any other transactions executing concurrently.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Durability or permanency. The changes applied to the database by a com- mitted transaction must persist in the database. These changes must not be lost because of any failure. The atomicity property  requires that we execute a transaction to completion. It is the responsibility of the transaction recovery subsystem  of a DBMS to ensure atomi- city. If a transaction fails to complete for some reason, such as a system crash in the midst of transaction execution, the recovery technique must undo any effects of the transaction on the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, write operations of a committed transaction must be eventually written to disk. The preservation of consistency  is generally considered to be the responsibility of the programmers who write the database programs and of the DBMS module that enforces integrity constraints. Recall that a database state  is a collection of all the stored data items (values) in the database at a given point in time. A  consistent state  of the database satisfies the constraints specified in the schema as well as any other constraints on the database that should hold.\n",
      "\n",
      "A database program should be written in a way that guarantees that, if the database is in a consistent state before executing the transaction, it will be in a consistent state after the complete  execution of the transaction, assuming that no interference with other transactions  occurs. The isolation property  is enforced by the concurrency control subsystem  of the DBMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "8 If every transaction does not make its updates (write operations) visible to other transactions until it is committed, one form of isolation is enforced that solves the temporary update problem and eliminates cascading rollbacks (see Chapter 22) but does not eliminate all other problems. The durability property  is the responsibility of the recovery subsystem  of the DBMS. In the next section, we introduce how recovery protocols enforce durability and atomicity and then discuss this in more detail in Chapter 22. Levels of Isolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "There have been attempts to define the level of isolation  of a transaction. A transaction is said to have level 0 (zero) isolation if it does not over- write the dirty reads of higher-level transactions. Level 1 (one) isolation has no lost updates, and level 2 isolation has no lost updates and no dirty reads. Finally, level 3 isolation (also called true isolation ) has, in addition to level 2 properties, repeatable reads.\n",
      "\n",
      "9 Another type of isolation is called snapshot isolation , and several practical concurrency control methods are based on this. We shall discuss snapshot isolation in Section 20.6, and again in Chapter 21, Section 21.4. 8We will discuss concurrency control protocols in Chapter 21. 9The SQL syntax for isolation level discussed in Section 20.6 is closely related to these levels. 20.4 Characterizing Schedules Based on Recoverability  759\n",
      "\n",
      "20.4  Characterizing Schedules Based   on Recoverability When transactions are executing concurrently in an interleaved fashion, then the order of execution of operations from all the various transactions is known as a schedule  (or history ). In this section, first we define the concept of schedules, and then we characterize the types of schedules that facilitate recovery when failures occur. In Section 20.5, we characterize schedules in terms of the interference of participating transactions; this discussion leads to the concepts of serializability and serializable schedules.\n",
      "\n",
      "20.4.1 Schedules (Histories) of Transactions A schedule  (or history ) S of n transactions T1, T2, … , Tn is an ordering of the operations of the transactions. Operations from different transactions can be interleaved in the schedule S. However, for each transaction T i that participates in the schedule S, the operations of Ti in S must appear in the same order in which they occur in Ti.\n",
      "\n",
      "The order of operations in S is considered to be a total ordering , meaning that for any two operations  in the schedule, one must occur before the other. It is possible theoretically to deal with schedules whose opera-tions form partial orders , but we will assume for now total ordering of the opera- tions in a schedule. For the purpose of recovery and concurrency control, we are mainly interested in the read_item  and write_item  operations of the transactions, as well as the commit  and abort  operations.\n",

      "A shorthand notation for describing a schedule uses the symbols b, r, w, e, c, and a for the operations begin_transaction , read_item , write_item , end_transaction , commit , and abort , respectively, and appends as a subscript  the transaction id (transaction number) to each operation in the schedule. In this notation, the database item X that is read or written follows the r and w operations in parentheses.\n",

Intuitively, two operations are conflicting if changing their order can result in a dif- ferent outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if we change the order of the two operations r1(X); w2(X) to w2(X); r1(X), then the value of X that is read by transaction T1 changes, because in the second ordering the value of X is read by r1(X) after  it is changed by w2(X), whereas in the first ordering the value is read before  it is changed. This is called a read-write conflict .\n",
      "\n",
      "The other type is called a write-write conflict  and is illustrated by the case where we change the order of two operations such as w1(X); w2(X) to w2(X); w1(X). For a write-write conflict, the last value  of X will differ because in one case it is written by T2 and in the other case by T1. Notice that two read operations are not conflicting because changing their order makes no differ-ence in outcome. The rest of this section covers some theoretical definitions concerning schedules.\n",
      "\n",
      "A schedule S of n transactions T 1, T2, … , Tn is said to be a complete schedule  if the following conditions hold: 1. The operations in S are exactly those operations in T1, T2, … , Tn, including a commit or abort operation as the last operation for each transaction in the schedule. 2. For any pair of operations from the same transaction Ti, their relative order of appearance in S is the same as their order of appearance in Ti. 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "For any two conflicting operations, one of the two must occur before the other in the schedule.10 The preceding condition (3) allows for two nonconflicting operations  to occur in the schedule without defining which occurs first, thus leading to the definition of a schedule as a partial order  of the operations in the n transactions.11 However, a total order must be specified in the schedule for any pair of conflicting operations (condition 3) and for any pair of operations from the same transaction (condi-tion 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition 1 simply states that all operations in the transactions must appear in the complete schedule. Since every transaction has either committed or aborted, a complete schedule will not contain any active transactions  at the end of the schedule. In general, it is difficult to encounter complete schedules in a transaction process- ing system because new transactions are continually being submitted to the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, it is useful to define the concept of the committed projection  C(S) of a schedule S, which includes only the operations in S that belong to committed trans- actions—that is, transactions T i whose commit operation ci is in S. 10Theoretically, it is not necessary to determine an order between pairs of nonconflicting  operations. 11In practice, most schedules have a total order of operations. If parallel processing is employed, it is theoretically possible to have schedules with partially ordered nonconflicting operations.\n",

      "\n",
      "20.4.2 Characterizing Schedules Based on Recoverability For some schedules it is easy to recover from transaction and system failures, whereas for other schedules the recovery process can be quite involved. In some cases, it is even not possible to recover correctly after a failure. Hence, it is impor-tant to characterize the types of schedules for which recovery is possible , as well as those for which recovery is relatively simple . These characterizations do not actually provide the recovery algorithm; they only attempt to theoretically characterize the different types of schedules.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we would like to ensure that, once a transaction T is committed, it should never  be necessary to roll back T. This ensures that the durability property of transactions is not violated (see Section 20.3). The schedules that theoretically meet this criterion are called recoverable schedules. A schedule where a committed transaction may have to be rolled back during recovery is called nonrecoverable and hence should not be permitted by the DBMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "The condition for a recoverable schedule  is as follows: A schedule S is recoverable if no transaction T in S commits until all transactions T′ that have written some item X that T reads have commit- ted. A transaction T reads  from transaction T′ in a schedule S if some item X is first written by T′ and later read by T. In addition, T′ should not have been aborted before T reads item X, and there should be no transactions that write X after T′ writes it and before T reads it (unless those transactions, if any, have aborted before T reads X).\n",
      "\n",
      "Some recoverable schedules may require a complex recovery process, as we shall see, but if sufficient information is kept (in the log), a recovery algorithm can be devised for any recoverable schedule. The (partial) schedules S a and Sb from the preceding section are both recoverable, since they satisfy the above definition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Con-sider the schedule S a′ given below, which is the same as schedule Sa except that two commit operations have been added to Sa: Sa′: r1(X); r2(X); w1(X); r1(Y); w2(X); c2; w1(Y); c1; Sa′ is recoverable, even though it suffers from the lost update problem; this problem is handled by serializability theory (see Section 20.5).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, consider the two (partial) schedules S c and Sd that follow: Sc: r1(X); w1(X); r2(X); r1(Y); w2(X); c2; a1; Sd: r1(X); w1(X); r2(X); r1(Y); w2(X); w1(Y); c1; c2; Se: r1(X); w1(X); r2(X); r1(Y); w2(X); w1(Y); a1; a2; Sc is not recoverable because T2 reads item X from T1, but T2 commits before T1 commits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem occurs if T1 aborts after the c2 operation in Sc; then the value of X that T2 read is no longer valid and T2 must be aborted after  it is committed, leading to a schedule that is not recoverable . For the schedule to be recoverable, the c2 operation in Sc must be postponed until after T1 commits, as shown in Sd. If T1 aborts instead of committing, then T2 should also abort as shown in Se, because the value of X it read is no longer valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Se, aborting T2 is acceptable since it has not committed yet, which is not the case for the nonrecoverable schedule Sc.762 Chapter 20 Introduction to Transaction Processing Concepts and Theory In a recoverable schedule, no committed transaction ever needs to be rolled back, and so the definition of a committed transaction as durable is not violated.\n",
      "\n",
      "How-ever, it is possible for a phenomenon known as cascading rollback  (or cascading abort ) to occur in some recoverable schedules, where an uncommitted  transaction has to be rolled back because it read an item from a transaction that failed. This is illustrated in schedule S e, where transaction T2 has to be rolled back because it read item X from T1, and T1 then aborted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because cascading rollback can be time-consuming—since numerous transactions can be rolled back (see Chapter 22)—it is important to characterize the schedules where this phenomenon is guaranteed not to occur. A schedule is said to be cascadeless , or to avoid cascading rollback , if every transaction in the schedule reads only items that were written by committed transactions. In this case, all items read will not be discarded because the transactions that wrote them have commit-ted, so no cascading rollback will occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "To satisfy this criterion, the r 2(X) com- mand in schedules Sd and Se must be postponed until after T1 has committed (or aborted), thus delaying T2 but ensuring no cascading rollback if T1 aborts. Finally, there is a third, more restrictive type of schedule, called a strict schedule , in which transactions can neither read nor write  an item X until the last transaction that wrote X has committed (or aborted). Strict schedules simplify the recovery process.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a strict schedule, the process of undoing a write_item (X) operation of an aborted transaction is simply to restore the before image  (old_value  or BFIM) of data item X. This simple procedure always works correctly for strict schedules, but it may not work for recoverable or cascadeless schedules.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, consider schedule Sf: Sf: w1(X, 5); w2(X, 8); a1; Suppose that the value of X was originally 9, which is the before image stored in the system log along with the w1(X, 5) operation. If T1 aborts, as in Sf, the recovery pro- cedure that restores the before image of an aborted write operation will restore the value of X to 9, even though it has already been changed to 8 by transaction T2, thus leading to potentially incorrect results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although schedule Sf is cascadeless, it is not a strict schedule, since it permits T2 to write item X even though the transaction T1 that last wrote X had not yet committed (or aborted). A strict schedule does not have this problem. It is important to note that any strict schedule is also cascadeless, and any cascade- less schedule is also recoverable. Suppose we have i transactions T1, T2, … , Ti, and their number of operations are n1, n2, … , ni, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we make a set of all possible schedules  of these transactions, we can divide the schedules into two dis- joint subsets: recoverable and nonrecoverable. The cascadeless schedules will be a subset of the recoverable schedules, and the strict schedules will be a subset of the cascadeless schedules. Thus, all strict schedules are cascadeless, and all cascadeless schedules are recoverable. Most recovery protocols allow only strict schedules, so that the recovery process itself is not complicated (see Chapter 22).\n",

      "20.5.1 Serial, Nonserial, and Conflict-Serializable Schedules Schedules A and B in Figures 20.5(a) and (b) are called serial  because the operations of each transaction are executed consecutively, without any interleaved operations from the other transaction.

Formally, a schedule S is serial  if, for every transaction T participating in the sched- ule, all the operations of T are executed consecutively in the schedule; otherwise, the schedule is called nonserial . Therefore, in a serial schedule, only one transaction at a time is active—the commit (or abort) of the active transaction initiates execution of the next transaction. No interleaving occurs in a serial schedule.\n",

We can assume this because every transac- tion is assumed to be correct if executed on its own (according to the consistency preservation  property of Section 20.3). Hence, it does not matter which transaction is executed first. As long as every transaction is executed from beginning to end in isolation from the operations of other transactions, we get a correct end result.\n",

Saying that a nonserial schedule S is serializable is equivalent to saying that it is cor- rect, because it is equivalent to a serial schedule, which is considered correct. The remaining question is: When are two schedules considered equivalent ?\n",

Additionally, these schedules execute different transactions, so they defi-nitely should not be considered equivalent. Hence, result equivalence alone cannot be used to define equivalence of schedules.\n",

      "The safest and most general approach to defining schedule equivalence is to focus only on the read_item and write_item operations of the transactions, and not make any assumptions about the other internal operations included in the transactions. For two schedules to be equivalent, the operations applied to each data item affected by the schedules should be applied to that item in both schedules in the same order . Two defini- tions of equivalence of schedules are generally used: conflict equivalence  and view equivalence . We discuss conflict equivalence next, which is the more commonly used definition.\n",

Factors such as system load, time of transaction submis- sion, and priorities of processes contribute to the ordering of operations in a sched-ule. Hence, it is difficult to determine how the operations of a schedule will be interleaved beforehand to ensure serializability.\n",
      "\n",
      "If transactions are executed at will and then the resulting schedule is tested for seri- alizability, we must cancel the effect of the schedule if it turns out not to be serializ- able. This is a serious problem that makes this approach impractical. The approach taken in most commercial DBMSs is to design protocols  (sets of rules) that—if followed by every  individual transaction or if enforced by a DBMS concurrency control subsystem—will ensure serializability of all schedules in which the transac- tions participate .\n",
      "\n",
      "Some protocols may allow nonserializable schedules in rare cases to reduce the overhead of the concurrency control method (see Section 20.6). Another problem is that transactions are submitted continuously to the system, so it is difficult to determine when a schedule begins and when it ends. Serializability theory can be adapted to deal with this problem by considering only the committed projection of a schedule S. Recall from Section 20.4.1 that the committed projection C(S) of a schedule S includes only the operations in S that belong to committed transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can theoretically define a schedule S to be serializable if its com- mitted projection C(S) is equivalent to some serial schedule, since only committed transactions are guaranteed by the DBMS. In Chapter 21, we discuss a number of different concurrency control protocols that guarantee serializability. The most common technique, called two-phase locking , is based on locking data items to prevent concurrent transactions from interfering with one another, and enforcing an additional condition that guaran-tees serializability. This is used in some commercial DBMSs.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will also discuss a protocol based on the concept of snapshot isolation  that ensures serializability in most but not all cases; this is used in some commercial DBMSs because it has less overhead than the two-phase locking protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other protocols have been proposed 14; these include timestamp ordering , where each transaction is assigned a unique timestamp and the protocol ensures that any conflicting operations are executed in the order of the transaction timestamps; multiversion protocols , which are based on maintaining multiple versions of data items; and optimistic (also called certification  or validation ) protocols , which check for possible serial- izability violations after the transactions terminate but before they are permitted to commit.\n",
      "\n",
      "20.5.4 View Equivalence and View Serializability In Section 20.5.1, we defined the concepts of conflict equivalence of schedules and conflict serializability. Another less restrictive definition of equivalence of sched-ules is called view equivalence .\n",
      "\n",
      "This leads to another definition of serializability 14These other protocols have not been incorporated much into commercial systems; most relational DBMSs use some variation of two-phase locking or snapshot isolation.772 Chapter 20 Introduction to Transaction Processing Concepts and Theory called view serializability . Two schedules S and S′ are said to be view equivalent  if the following three conditions hold: 1. The same set of transactions participates in S and S′, and S and S′ include the same operations of those transactions. 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "For any operation ri(X) of Ti in S, if the value of X read by the operation has been written by an operation wj(X) of Tj (or if it is the original value of X before the schedule started), the same condition must hold for the value of X read by operation ri(X) of Ti in S′. 3. If the operation wk(Y) of Tk is the last operation to write item Y in S, then wk(Y) of Tk must also be the last operation to write item Y in S′.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea behind view equivalence is that, as long as each read operation of a trans- action reads the result of the same write operation in both schedules, the write operations of each transaction must produce the same results. The read operations are hence said to see the same view  in both schedules. Condition 3 ensures that the final write operation on each data item is the same in both schedules, so the data-base state should be the same at the end of both schedules. A schedule S is said to be view serializable  if it is view equivalent to a serial schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "The definitions of conflict serializability and view serializability are similar if a condition known as the constrained write assumption  (or no blind writes ) holds on all transactions in the schedule. This condition states that any write operation w i(X) in Ti is preceded by a ri(X) in Ti and that the value written by wi(X) in Ti depends only on the value of X read by ri(X). This assumes that computation of the new value of X is a function f(X) based on the old value of X read from the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "A blind write  is a write operation in a transaction T on an item X that is not dependent on the old value of X, so it is not preceded by a read of X in the transaction T. The definition of view serializability is less restrictive than that of conflict serializ- ability under the unconstrained write assumption , where the value written by an operation wi(X) in Ti can be independent of its old value.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is possible when blind writes  are allowed, and it is illustrated by the following schedule Sg of three transactions T1: r1(X); w1(X); T2: w2(X); and T3: w3(X): Sg: r1(X); w2(X); w1(X); w3(X); c1; c2; c3; In Sg the operations w2(X) and w3(X) are blind writes, since T2 and T3 do not read the value of X.\n",
      "\n",
      "The schedule Sg is view serializable, since it is view equivalent to the serial schedule T1, T2, T3. However, Sg is not conflict serializable, since it is not con- flict equivalent to any serial schedule (as an exercise, the reader should construct the serializability graph for S g and check for cycles). It has been shown that any conflict-serializable schedule is also view serializable but not vice versa, as illus-trated by the preceding example. There is an algorithm to test whether a schedule S is view serializable or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the problem of testing for view serializability has been shown to be NP-hard, meaning that finding an efficient polynomial time algorithm for this problem is highly unlikely. 20.6 Transaction Support in SQL  773\n",
      "\n",
      "20.5.5 Other Types of Equivalence of Schedules Serializability of schedules is sometimes considered to be too restrictive as a condition for ensuring the correctness of concurrent executions. Some applica-tions can produce schedules that are correct by satisfying conditions less strin-gent than either conflict serializability or view serializability. An example is the type of transactions known as debit-credit transactions —for example, those that apply deposits and withdrawals to a data item whose value is the current balance of a bank account.\n",
      "\n",
      "The semantics of debit-credit operations is that they update the value of a data item X by either subtracting from or adding to the value of the data item. Because addition and subtraction operations are com-mutative—that is, they can be applied in any order—it is possible to produce correct schedules that are not serializable.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, consider the following transactions, each of which may be used to transfer an amount of money between two bank accounts: T 1: r1(X); X :{equal} X − 10; w1(X); r1(Y); Y :{equal} Y + 10; w1(Y); T2: r2(Y); Y :{equal} Y − 20; w2(Y); r2(X); X :{equal} X + 20; w2(X); Consider the following nonserializable schedule Sh for the two transactions: Sh: r1(X); w1(X); r2(Y); w2(Y); r1(Y); w1(Y); r2(X); w2(X); With the additional knowledge, or semantics , that the operations between each ri(I) and wi(I) are commutative, we know that the order of executing the sequences consisting of (read, update, write) is not important as long as each (read, update, write) sequence by a particular transaction T i on a particular item I is not interrupted by conflicting operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, the schedule Sh is consid- ered to be correct even though it is not serializable. Researchers have been work-ing on extending concurrency control theory to deal with cases where serializability is considered to be too restrictive as a condition for correctness of schedules. Also, in certain domains of applications, such as computer-aided design (CAD) of complex systems like aircraft, design transactions last over a long time period. In such applications, more relaxed schemes of concurrency control have been proposed to maintain consistency of the database, such as eventual consistency .\n",

      "20.6 Transaction Support in SQL   In this section, we give a brief introduction to transaction support in SQL. There are many more details, and the newer standards have more commands for trans-action processing. The basic definition of an SQL transaction is similar to our already defined concept of a transaction. That is, it is a logical unit of work and is guaranteed to be atomic.\n",

      "A single SQL statement is always considered to be atomic—either it completes execution without an error or it fails and leaves the database unchanged.774 Chapter 20 Introduction to Transaction Processing Concepts and Theory With SQL, there is no explicit Begin_Transaction  statement. Transaction initiation is done implicitly when particular SQL statements are encountered. However, every transaction must have an explicit end statement, which is either a COMMIT  or a ROLLBACK . Every transaction has certain characteristics attributed to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "These characteristics are specified by a SET TRANSACTION  statement in SQL. The charac- teristics are the access mode , the diagnostic area size , and the isolation level . The access mode  can be specified as READ ONLY  or READ WRITE . The default is READ WRITE , unless the isolation level of READ UNCOMMITTED  is specified (see below), in which case READ ONLY  is assumed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A mode of READ WRITE  allows select, update, insert, delete, and create commands to be executed. A mode of READ ONLY , as the name implies, is simply for data retrieval. The diagnostic area size  option, DIAGNOSTIC SIZE  n, specifies an integer value n, which indicates the number of conditions that can be held simultaneously in the diagnostic area. These conditions supply feedback information (errors or excep-tions) to the user or program on the n most recently executed SQL statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The isolation level  option is specified using the statement ISOLATION LEVEL <isolation> , where the value for < isolation > can be READ UNCOMMITTED , READ COMMITTED , REPEATABLE  READ , or SERIALIZABLE .15 The default isolation level is SERIALIZABLE , although some systems use READ COMMITTED  as their default.\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of the term SERIALIZABLE  here is based on not allowing violations that cause dirty read, unre- peatable read, and phantoms,16 and it is thus not identical to the way serializability was defined earlier in Section 20.5. If a transaction executes at a lower isolation level than SERIALIZABLE , then one or more of the following three violations may occur: 1. Dirty read. A transaction T1 may read the update of a transaction T2, which has not yet committed.\n",
      "\n",
      "If T2 fails and is aborted, then T1 would have read a value that does not exist and is incorrect. 2. Nonrepeatable read. A transaction T1 may read a given value from a table. If another transaction T2 later updates that value and T1 reads that value again, T1 will see a different value. 3. Phantoms. A transaction T1 may read a set of rows from a table, perhaps based on some condition specified in the SQL WHERE -clause.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now suppose that a transaction T2 inserts a new row r that also satisfies the WHERE -clause condition used in T1, into the table used by T1. The record r is called a phantom record  because it was not there when T1 starts but is there when T1 ends. T1 may or may not see the phantom, a row that previously did not exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the equivalent serial order is T1 followed by T2, then the record r should not be seen; but if it is T2 followed by T1,then the phantom record should be in the result given to T1. If the system cannot ensure the correct behavior, then it does not deal with the phantom record problem. 15These are similar to the isolation levels  discussed briefly at the end of Section 20.3. 16The dirty read and unrepeatable read problems were discussed in Section 20.1.3.\n",

An entry of Yes indicates that a violation is possible and an entry of No indicates that it is not possible. READ UNCOMMITTED  is the most forgiving, and SERIALIZABLE  is the most restrictive in that it avoids all three of the problems mentioned above.\n",

      "\n",
      "If an error occurs on any of the SQL statements, the entire transaction is rolled back. This implies that any updated salary (by this transaction) would be restored to its previ-ous value and that the newly inserted row would be removed.

The DBA or database programmers can take advantage of these options to try improv-ing transaction performance by relaxing serializability if that is acceptable for their applications. Snapshot Isolation.\n",

      "Another isolation level, known as snapshot isolation, is used in some commercial DBMSs, and some concurrency control protocols exist that are based on this concept.

      "20.7 Summary   In this chapter, we discussed DBMS concepts for transaction processing. We intro-duced the concept of a database transaction and the operations relevant to transac-tion processing in Section 20.1. We compared single-user systems to multiuser systems and then presented examples of how uncontrolled execution of concurrent transactions in a multiuser system can lead to incorrect results and database values in Section 20.1.1. We also discussed the various types of failures that may occur during transaction execution in Section 20.1.4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, in Section 20.2, we introduced the typical states that a transaction passes through during execution, and discussed several concepts that are used in recovery and concurrency control methods. The system log (Section 20.2.2) keeps track of database accesses, and the system uses this information to recover from failures. A transaction can succeed and reach its commit point, or it can fail and has to be rolled back. A committed transaction (Section 20.2.3) has its changes permanently recorded in the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Section 20.3, we presented an overview of the desirable properties of transactions—atomicity, consistency preservation, isolation, and durability—which are often referred to as the ACID properties. Then we defined a schedule (or history) as an execution sequence of the opera- tions of several transactions with interleaving in Section 20.4.1. We character-ized schedules in terms of their recoverability in Section 20.4.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recoverable schedules ensure that, once a transaction commits, it never needs to be undone. Cascadeless schedules add an additional condition to ensure that no aborted transaction requires the cascading abort of other transactions. Strict schedules provide an even stronger condition that allows a simple recovery scheme con-sisting of restoring the old values of items that have been changed by an aborted transaction. Then in Section 20.5 we defined the equivalence of schedules and saw that a serial- izable schedule is equivalent to some serial schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "We defined the concepts of conflict equivalence and view equivalence. A serializable schedule is considered correct. We presented an algorithm for testing the (conflict) serializability of a schedule in Section 20.5.2. We discussed why testing for serializability is impracti-cal in a real system, although it can be used to define and verify concurrency con-trol protocols in Section 20.5.3, and we briefly mentioned less restrictive definitions of schedule equivalence in Sections 20.5.4 and 20.5.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, in Section 20.6, we gave a brief overview of how transaction concepts are used in practice within SQL, and we introduced the concept of snapshot isolation, which is used in several com-mercial DBMSs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the main techniques used to control concurrent execution of transactions are based on the concept of locking data items. A lock  is a variable associated with a data item that describes the status of the item with respect to possible operations that can be applied to it. Generally, there is one lock for each data item in the data- base. Locks are used as a means of synchronizing the access by concurrent transac- tions to the database items. In Section 21.1.1, we discuss the nature and types of locks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, in Section 21.1.2, we present protocols that use locking to guarantee serializability of transaction schedules. Finally, in Section 21.1.3, we describe two problems associated with the use of locks—deadlock and starvation—and show how these problems are handled in concurrency control protocols.\n",

      "21.1.1 Types of Locks and System Lock Tables Several types of locks are used in concurrency control. To introduce locking con-cepts gradually, first we discuss binary locks, which are simple but are also too restrictive for database concurrency control purposes  and so are not used much. Then we discuss shared/exclusive  locks—also known as read/write  locks—which provide more general locking capabilities and are used in database locking schemes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Section 21.3.2, we describe an additional type of lock called a certify lock , and we show how it can be used to improve performance of locking protocols. Binary Locks. A binary lock  can have two states  or values : locked and unlocked (or 1 and 0, for simplicity). A distinct lock is associated with each database item X. If the value of the lock on X is 1, item X cannot be accessed  by a database operation that requests the item.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the value of the lock on X is 0, the item can be accessed when requested, and the lock value is changed to 1. We refer to the current value (or state) of the lock associated with item X as lock( X). Two operations, lock_item  and unlock_item , are used with binary locking. A trans- action requests access to an item X by first issuing a lock_item( X) operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "If  21.1 Two-Phase Locking Techniques for Concurrency Control  783 LOCK (X) = 1, the transaction is forced to wait. If LOCK (X) = 0, it is set to 1 (the transaction locks  the item) and the transaction is allowed to access item X. When the transaction is through using the item, it issues an unlock_item( X) operation, which sets LOCK (X) back to 0 ( unlocks  the item) so that X may be accessed by other transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, a binary lock enforces mutual exclusion  on the data item. A description of the lock_item (X) and unlock_item (X) operations is shown in Figure 21.1. Notice that the lock_item  and unlock_item  operations must be implemented as indi- visible units (known as critical sections  in operating systems); that is, no interleav- ing should be allowed once a lock or unlock operation is started until the operation terminates or the transaction waits.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Figure 21.1, the wait command within the lock_item (X) operation is usually implemented by putting the transaction in a wait- ing queue for item X until X is unlocked and the transaction can be granted access to it. Other transactions that also want to access X are placed in the same queue. Hence, the wait command is considered to be outside the lock_item  operation. It is simple to implement a binary lock; all that is needed is a binary-valued variable, LOCK , associated with each data item X in the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "In its simplest form, each lock can be a record with three fields: < Data_item_name , LOCK , Locking_transaction > plus a queue for transactions that are waiting to access the item. The system needs to maintain only these records for the items that are currently locked  in a lock table , which could be organized as a hash file on the item name. Items not in the lock table are considered to be unlocked. The DBMS has a lock manager subsystem  to keep track of and control access to locks.\n",

      "If the simple binary locking scheme described here is used, every transaction must obey the following rules: 1. A transaction T must issue the operation lock_item (X) before any read_item (X) or write_item (X) operations are performed in T. 2.\n",

A transaction T will not issue an unlock_item( X) operation unless it already holds the lock on item X. These rules can be enforced by the lock manager module of the DBMS. Between the lock_item (X) and unlock_item (X) operations in transaction T, T is said to hold the lock  on item X. At most one transaction can hold the lock on a particular item.\n",

      "Thus no two transactions can access the same item concurrently. Shared/Exclusive (or Read/Write) Locks. The preceding binary locking scheme is too restrictive for database items because at most one transaction can hold a lock on a given item. We should allow several transactions to access the same item X if they all access X for reading purposes only . This is because read operations on the same item by different transactions are not conflicting  (see Sec- tion 21.4.1).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if a transaction is to write an item X, it must have exclusive access to X. For this purpose, a different type of lock, called a multiple-mode lock , is used. In this scheme—called shared/exclusive  or read/write  locks—there are three locking operations: read_lock (X), write_lock (X), and unlock (X). A lock associated with an item X, LOCK (X), now has three possible states: read-locked , write-locked , or unlocked .\n",
      "\n",
      "A read-locked item  is also called share-locked  because other transactions are allowed to read the item, whereas a write-locked item  is called exclusive-locked  because a single transaction exclusively holds the lock on the item.

      "Each record in the lock table will have four fields: < Data_item_name , LOCK , No_of_reads , Locking_transaction(s) >.

Rather, the transaction waits and then tries again to lock all the items it needs. Obviously, this solution further limits concurrency.\n",

      "The wound-wait approach does the opposite: A younger transaction is allowed to wait for an older one , whereas an older transaction requesting an item held by a younger transaction preempts  the younger transaction by aborting it. Both schemes end up aborting the younger  of the two transactions (the transaction that started later) that may be involved  in a deadlock, assuming that this will waste less processing.

It can be shown that cautious waiting is deadlock-free, because no transaction will ever wait for another blocked transaction.\n",

      "By considering the time b(T) at which each blocked transaction T was blocked, if the two transactions Ti and Tj above both become blocked and Ti is waiting for Tj, then b(Ti) < b(Tj), since Ti can only wait for Tj at a time when Tj is not blocked itself. Hence, the blocking times form a total ordering on all blocked transactions, so no cycle that causes deadlock can occur. Deadlock Detection. An alternative approach to dealing with deadlock is deadlock detection , where the system checks if a state of deadlock actually exists.\n",

      "This solution is attractive if we know there will be little interference among the transactions—that is, if different transactions will rarely access the same items at the same time. This can happen if the transactions are short and each transaction locks only a few items, or if the transaction load is light. On the other hand, if trans-actions are long and each transaction uses many items, or if the transaction load is heavy, it may be advantageous to use a deadlock prevention scheme.\n",

      "A simple way to detect a state of deadlock is for the system to construct and main- tain a wait-for graph . One node is created in the wait-for graph for each transac- tion that is currently executing.

      "When Tj releases the lock(s) on the items that Ti was 792 Chapter 21 Concurrency Control Techniques waiting for, the directed edge is dropped from the wait-for graph. We have a state of deadlock if and only if the wait-for graph has a cycle. One problem with this approach is the matter of determining when  the system should check for a dead- lock. One possibility is to check for a cycle every time an edge is added to the wait-for graph, but this may cause excessive overhead.\n",

Choosing which transactions to abort is known as victim selection .\n",

Timeouts. Another simple scheme to deal with deadlock is the use of timeouts . This method is practical because of its low overhead and simplicity. In this method, if a transaction waits for a period longer than a system-defined timeout period, the system assumes that the transaction may be deadlocked and aborts it—regardless of whether a deadlock actually exists.\n",

      "Starvation. Another problem that may occur when we use locking is starvation , which occurs when a transaction cannot proceed for an indefinite period of time while other transactions in the system continue normally. This may occur if the waiting scheme for locked items is unfair in that it gives priority to some transac-tions over others. One solution for starvation is to have a fair waiting scheme, such as using a first-come-first-served  queue; transactions are enabled to lock an item in the order in which they originally requested the lock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another scheme allows some transactions to have priority over others but increases the priority of a trans-action the longer it waits, until it eventually gets the highest priority and proceeds. Starvation can also occur because of victim selection if the algorithm selects the same transaction as victim repeatedly, thus causing it to abort and never finish exe-cution. The algorithm can use higher priorities for transactions that have been aborted multiple times to avoid this problem.\n",

Typically, timestamp values are assigned in the order in which the transactions are submitted to the system, so a timestamp can be thought of as the transaction start time .

Timestamps can be generated in several ways.\n",

A computer counter has a finite maximum value, so the system must periodically reset the counter to zero when no transactions are executing for some short period of time. Another way to implement timestamps is to use the current date/time value of the system clock and ensure that no two timestamp values are generated during the same tick of the clock.\n",

The algorithm allows inter-leaving of transaction operations, but it must ensure that for each pair of conflicting operations  in the schedule, the order in which the item is accessed must follow the timestamp order. To do this, the algorithm associates with each database item X two timestamp (TS) values: 1. read_TS( X).\n",

Some multiversion concurrency control algo- rithms use the concept of view serializability rather than conflict serializability. An obvious drawback of multiversion techniques is that more storage is needed to maintain multiple versions of the database items.\n",

The extreme case is a temporal database  (see Section 26.2), which keeps track of all changes and the times at which they occurred. In such cases, there is no additional storage penalty for multiversion techniques, since older versions are already maintained.\n",

      "\n",
      "21.5.1 Granularity Level Considerations for Locking The size of data items is often called the data item granularity . Fine granularity refers to small item sizes, whereas coarse granularity  refers to large item sizes. Sev- eral tradeoffs must be considered in choosing the data item size. We will discuss data item size in the context of locking, although similar arguments can be made for other concurrency control techniques. First, notice that the larger the data item size is, the lower the degree of concurrency permitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if the data item size is a disk block, a transaction T that needs to lock a single record B must lock the whole disk block X that contains B because a lock is associated with the whole data item (block). Now, if another trans-action S wants to lock a different record C that happens to reside in the same disk block X in a conflicting lock mode, it is forced to wait. If the data item size was a single record instead of a disk block, transaction S would be able to proceed, because it would be locking a different data item (record).\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, the smaller the data item size is, the more the number of items in the database. Because every item is associated with a lock, the system will have a larger number of active locks to be handled by the lock manager. More lock and unlock operations will be performed, causing a higher overhead. In addition, more storage space will be required for the lock table. For timestamps, storage is required for the read_TS  and write_TS  for each data item, and there will be similar overhead for handling a large number of items.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the above tradeoffs, an obvious question can be asked: What is the best item size? The answer is that it depends on the types of transactions involved . If a typical transaction accesses a small number of records, it is advantageous to have the data item granularity be one record. On the other hand, if a transaction typically accesses many records in the same file, it may be better to have block or file granularity so that the transaction will consider all those records as one (or a few) data items.\n",
      "\n",
      "21.5.2 Multiple Granularity Level Locking Since the best granularity size depends on the given transaction, it seems appropri-ate that a database system should support multiple levels of granularity, where the granularity level can be adjusted dynamically for various mixes of transactions. Fig- ure 21.7 shows a simple granularity hierarchy with a database containing two files, each file containing several disk pages, and each page containing several records.\n",
      "\n",
      "This can be used to illustrate a multiple granularity level  2PL protocol, with shared/exclusive locking modes, where a lock can be requested at any level. How-ever, additional types of locks will be needed to support such a protocol efficiently.802 Chapter 21 Concurrency Control Techniques Consider the following scenario, which refers to the example in Figure 21.7. Sup- pose transaction T1 wants to update all the records  in file f1, and T1 requests and is granted an exclusive lock for f1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then all of f1’s pages ( p11 through p1n)—and the records contained on those pages—are locked in exclusive mode. This is beneficial for T 1 because setting a single file-level lock is more efficient than setting n page- level locks or having to lock each record individually. Now suppose another trans-action T 2 only wants to read record r1nj from page p1n of file f1; then T2 would request a shared record-level lock on r1nj.\n",

      "However, the database system (that is, the transaction manager or, more specifically, the lock manager) must verify the com-patibility of the requested lock with already held locks. One way to verify this is to traverse the tree from the leaf r 1nj to p1n to f1 to db. If at any time a conflicting lock is held on any of those items, then the lock request for r1nj is denied and T2 is blocked and must wait. This traversal would be fairly efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, what if transaction T2’s request came before  transaction T1’s request? In this case, the shared record lock is granted to T2 for r1nj, but when T1’s file-level lock is requested, it can be time-consuming for the lock manager to check all nodes (pages and records) that are descendants of node f 1 for a lock conflict. This would be very inefficient and would defeat the purpose of having multiple granularity level locks.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make multiple granularity level locking practical, additional types of locks, called intention locks , are needed. The idea behind intention locks is for a transac- tion to indicate, along the path from the root to the desired node, what type of lock (shared or exclusive) it will require from one of the node’s descendants. There are three types of intention locks: 1. Intention-shared (IS) indicates that one or more shared locks will be requested on some descendant node(s). 2.\n",

      "A transaction T can unlock a node, N, only if none of the children of node N are currently locked by T. Rule 1 simply states that conflicting locks cannot be granted.

      "\n",
      "21.6  Using Locks for Concurrency   Control in Indexes Two-phase locking can also be applied to B-tree and B+-tree indexes (see Chap- ter 19), where the nodes of an index correspond to disk pages. However, holding locks on index pages until the shrinking phase of 2PL could cause an undue amount of transaction blocking because searching an index always starts at the root.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if a transaction wants to insert a record (write operation), the root would be locked in exclusive mode, so all other conflicting lock requests for the index must wait until the transaction enters its shrinking phase. This blocks all other transactions from accessing the index, so in practice other approaches to locking an index must be used. The tree structure of the index can be taken advantage of when developing a con- currency control scheme. For example, when an index search (read operation) is being executed, a path in the tree is traversed from the root to a leaf.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once a lower-level node in the path has been accessed, the higher-level nodes in that path will not be used again. So once a read lock on a child node is obtained, the lock on the par-ent node can be released. When an insertion is being applied to a leaf node (that is, when a key and a pointer are inserted), then a specific leaf node must be locked in exclusive mode. However, if that node is not full, the insertion will not cause changes to higher-level index nodes, which implies that they need not be locked exclusively.\n",
      "\n",
      "A conservative approach for insertions would be to lock the root node in exclusive mode and then to access the appropriate child node of the root. If the child node is not full, then the lock on the root node can be released. This approach can be applied all the way down the tree to the leaf, which is typically three or four levels from the root. Although exclusive locks are held, they are soon released.\n",
      "\n",
      "An alterna-tive, more optimistic approach  would be to request and hold shared  locks on the nodes leading to the leaf node, with an exclusive  lock on the leaf. If the insertion causes the leaf to split, insertion will propagate to one or more higher-level nodes. Then, the locks on the higher-level nodes can be upgraded to exclusive mode. Another approach to index locking is to use a variant of the B +-tree, called the B-link tree .\n",
      "\n",
      "In a B-link tree, sibling nodes on the same level are linked at every level. This allows shared locks to be used when requesting a page and requires that the lock be released before accessing the child node. For an insert operation, the shared lock on a node would be upgraded to exclusive mode. If a split occurs, the parent node must be relocked in exclusive mode. One complication is for search opera-tions executed concurrently with the update. Suppose that a concurrent update operation follows the same path as the search and inserts a new entry into the leaf node.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, suppose that the insert causes that leaf node to split. When the insert is done, the search process resumes, following the pointer to the desired leaf, only to find that the key it is looking for is not present because the split has moved that key into a new leaf node, which would be the right sibling  of the original leaf 806 Chapter 21 Concurrency Control Techniques node. However, the search process can still succeed if it follows the pointer (link) in the original leaf node to its right sibling, where the desired key has been moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Handling the deletion case, where two or more nodes from the index tree merge, is also part of the B-link tree concurrency protocol. In this case, locks on the nodes to be merged are held as well as a lock on the parent of the two nodes to be merged.\n",
      "\n",
      "21.7 Other Concurrency Control Issues   In this section, we discuss some other issues relevant to concurrency control. In Section 21.7.1, we discuss problems associated with insertion and deletion of records and we revisit the phantom problem , which may occur when records are inserted. This problem was described as a potential problem requiring a concur-rency control measure in Section 20.6.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Section 21.7.2, we discuss problems that may occur when a transaction outputs some data to a monitor before it commits, and then the transaction is later aborted.\n",
      "\n",
      "21.7.1 Insertion, Deletion, and Phantom Records When a new data item is inserted  in the database, it obviously cannot be accessed until after the item is created and the insert operation is completed. In a locking environment, a lock for the item can be created and set to exclusive (write) mode; the lock can be released at the same time as other write locks would be released, based on the concurrency control protocol being used.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a timestamp-based pro-tocol, the read and write timestamps of the new item are set to the timestamp of the creating transaction. Next, consider a deletion operation  that is applied on an existing data item. For locking protocols, again an exclusive (write) lock must be obtained before the trans-action can delete the item. For timestamp ordering, the protocol must ensure that no later transaction has read or written the item before allowing the item to be deleted.\n",
      "\n",
      "A situation known as the phantom problem  can occur when a new record that is being inserted by some transaction T satisfies a condition that a set of records accessed by another transaction T′ must satisfy. For example, suppose that transac- tion T is inserting a new EMPLOYEE  record whose Dno = 5, whereas transaction T′ is accessing all EMPLOYEE  records whose Dno = 5 (say, to add up all their Salary values to calculate the personnel budget for department 5).\n",
      "\n",
      "If the equivalent serial order is T followed by T′, then T′ must read the new EMPLOYEE  record and include its Salary  in the sum calculation. For the equivalent serial order T′ followed by T, the new salary should not be included. Notice that although the transactions logically conflict, in the latter case there is really no record (data item) in common between the two transactions, since T′ may have locked all the records with Dno = 5 before T inserted the new record.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is because the record that causes the conflict is a phantom record  that has suddenly appeared in the database on being inserted. If other operations in the two transactions conflict, the conflict due to the phantom record may not be recognized by the concurrency control protocol. 21.8 Summary  807 One solution to the phantom record problem is to use index locking , as discussed in Section 21.6. Recall from Chapter 19 that an index includes entries that have an attribute value plus a set of pointers to all records in the file with that value.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, an index on Dno of EMPLOYEE  would include an entry for each distinct Dno value plus a set of pointers to all EMPLOYEE  records with that value. If the index entry is locked before the record itself can be accessed, then the conflict on the phantom record can be detected, because transaction T′ would request a read lock on the index entry  for Dno = 5, and T would request a write lock on the same entry before  it could place the locks on the actual records.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the index locks conflict, the phantom conflict would be detected. A more general technique, called predicate locking , would lock access to all records that satisfy an arbitrary predicate  (condition) in a similar manner; however, predi- cate locks have proved to be difficult to implement efficiently. If the concurrency control method is based on snapshot isolation (see Section 21.4.2), then the trans-action that reads the items will access the database snapshot at the time the transac-tion starts; any records inserted after that will not be retrieved by the transaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "21.7.2 Interactive Transactions Another problem occurs when interactive transactions read input and write output to an interactive device, such as a monitor screen, before they are committed. The problem is that a user can input a value of a data item to a transaction T that is based on some value written to the screen by transaction T′, which may not have committed. This dependency between T and T′ cannot be modeled by the system concurrency control method, since it is only based on the user interacting with the two transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "An approach to dealing with this problem is to postpone output of transactions to the screen until they have committed.\n",
      "\n",
      "21.7.3 Latches Locks held for a short duration are typically called latches . Latches do not follow the usual concurrency control protocol such as two-phase locking. For example, a latch can be used to guarantee the physical integrity of a disk page when that page is being written from the buffer to disk. A latch would be acquired for the page, the page written to disk, and then the latch released.\n",
      "\n",
      "21.8 Summary   In this chapter, we discussed DBMS techniques for concurrency control. We started in Section 21.1 by discussing lock-based protocols, which are commonly used in practice. In Section 21.1.2 we described the two-phase locking (2PL) pro-tocol and a number of its variations: basic 2PL, strict 2PL, conservative 2PL, and rigorous 2PL.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strict and rigorous variations are more common because of 808 Chapter 21 Concurrency Control Techniques their better recoverability properties. We introduced the concepts of shared (read) and exclusive (write) locks (Section 21.1.1) and showed how locking can guarantee serializability when used in conjunction with the two-phase locking rule. We also presented various techniques for dealing with the deadlock problem in Sec-tion 21.1.3, which can occur with locking.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, it is common to use time-outs and deadlock detection (wait-for graphs). Deadlock prevention protocols, such as no waiting and cautious waiting, can also be used. We then presented other concurrency control protocols. These include the time- stamp ordering protocol (Section 21.2), which ensures serializability based on the order of transaction timestamps. Timestamps are unique, system-generated trans-action identifiers. We discussed Thomas’s write rule, which improves performance but does not guarantee serializability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strict timestamp ordering protocol was also presented. We discussed two multiversion protocols (Section 21.3), which assume that older versions of data items can be kept in the database. One tech-nique, called multiversion two-phase locking (which has been used in practice), assumes that two versions can exist for an item and attempts to increase concur-rency by making write and read locks compatible (at the cost of introducing an additional certify lock mode). We also presented a multiversion protocol based on timestamp ordering.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Section 21.4.1, we presented an example of an optimistic protocol, which is also known as a certification or validation protocol. We then discussed concurrency control methods that are based on the concept of snapshot isolation in Section 21.4.2; these are used in several DBMSs because of their lower overhead. The basic snapshot isolation method can allow nonserializ-able schedules in rare cases because of certain anomalies that are difficult to detect; these anomalies may cause a corrupted database.\n",
      "\n",
      "A variation known as serializable snapshot isolation has been recently developed and ensures serializable schedules. Then in Section 21.5 we turned our attention to the important practical issue of data item granularity. We described a multigranularity locking protocol that allows the change of granularity (item size) based on the current transaction mix, with the goal of improving the performance of concurrency control.\n",
      "\n",
      "An important practical issue was then presented in Section 21.6, which is to develop locking protocols for indexes so that indexes do not become a hindrance to con-current access. Finally, in Section 21.7, we introduced the phantom problem and problems with interactive transactions, and we briefly described the concept of latches and how this concept differs from locks. Review Questions\n",
      "\n",
      "22.1.1  Recovery Outline and Categorization of Recovery Algorithms Recovery from transaction failures usually means that the database is restored  to the most recent consistent state before the time of failure. To do this, the system must keep information about the changes that were applied to data items by the various transactions. This information is typically kept in the system log , as we discussed in Section 21.2.2. A typical strategy for recovery may be summarized informally as follows: 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there is extensive damage to a wide portion of the database due to cata-strophic failure, such as a disk crash, the recovery method restores a past copy of the database that was backed up  to archival storage (typically tape or other large capacity offline storage media) and reconstructs a more current state by reapplying or redoing  the operations of committed transactions from the backed-up  log, up to the time of failure. 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the database on disk is not physically damaged, and a noncatastrophic failure of types 1 through 4 in Section 21.1.4 has occurred, the recovery strategy is to identify any changes that may cause an inconsistency in the database. For example, a transaction that has updated some database items on disk but has not been committed needs to have its changes reversed by undoing  its write operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may also be necessary to redo  some opera- tions in order to restore a consistent state of the database; for example, if a transaction has committed but some of its write operations have not yet been written to disk. For noncatastrophic failure, the recovery protocol does not need a complete archival copy of the database. Rather, the entries kept in the online system log on disk are analyzed to determine the appropriate actions for recovery. Conceptually, we can distinguish two main policies for recovery from non- catastrophic transaction failures: deferred update and immediate update.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deferred update  techniques do not physically update the database on disk until after a transaction commits; then the updates are recorded in the database. Before reach-ing commit, all transaction updates are recorded in the local transaction workspace or in the main memory buffers that the DBMS maintains (the DBMS main memory cache; see Section 20.2.4). Before commit, the updates are recorded persistently in the log file on disk, and then after commit, the updates are written to the database from the main memory buffers.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a transaction fails before reaching its commit point, it will not have changed the database on disk in any way, so UNDO  is not needed. It may be necessary to REDO  the effect of the operations of a committed  22.1 Recovery Concepts  815 transaction from the log, because their effect may not yet have been recorded in the database on disk. Hence, deferred update is also known as the NO-UNDO/REDO algorithm . We discuss this technique in Section 22.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the immediate update  techniques, the database may be updated  by some opera- tions of a transaction before  the transaction reaches its commit point. However, these operations must also be recorded in the log on disk  by force-writing before they are applied to the database on disk, making recovery still possible. If a trans- action fails after recording some changes in the database on disk but before reach- ing its commit point, the effect of its operations on the database must be undone; that is, the transaction must be rolled back.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the general case of immediate update, both undo  and redo  may be required during recovery. This technique, known as the UNDO/REDO  algorithm , requires both operations during recovery and is used most often in practice. A variation of the algorithm where all updates are required to be recorded in the database on disk before  a transaction commits requires undo  only, so it is known as the UNDO/NO-REDO  algorithm . We discuss these two techniques in Section 22.3.\n",
      "\n",
      "The UNDO  and REDO  operations are required to be idempotent —that is, executing an operation multiple times is equivalent to executing it just once. In fact, the whole recovery process should be idempotent because if the system were to fail during the recovery process, the next recovery attempt might UNDO  and REDO  certain write_item  operations that had already been executed during the first recovery pro- cess. The result of recovery from a system crash during recovery  should be the same as the result of recovering when there is no crash during recovery !\n",
      "\n",
      "22.1.2 Caching (Buffering) of Disk Blocks The recovery process is often closely intertwined with operating system func- tions—in particular, the buffering of database disk pages in the DBMS main memory cache. Typically, multiple disk pages that include the data items to be updated are cached  into main memory buffers and then updated in memory before being written back to disk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The caching of disk pages is traditionally an operating system function, but because of its importance to the efficiency of recovery procedures, it is handled by the DBMS by calling low-level operating systems routines (see Section 20.2.4). In general, it is convenient to consider recovery in terms of the database disk pages (blocks). Typically a collection of in-memory buffers, called the DBMS cache , is kept under the control of the DBMS for the purpose of holding these buffers.\n",
      "\n",
      "A directory  for the cache is used to keep track of which database items are in the buf- fers. 1 This can be a table of < Disk_page_address , Buffer_location , … > entries. When the DBMS requests action on some item, first it checks the cache directory to deter-mine whether the disk page containing the item is in the DBMS cache.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it is not, 1This is somewhat similar to the concept of page tables used by the operating system.816 Chapter 22 Database Recovery Techniques the item must be located on disk, and the appropriate disk pages are copied into the cache. It may be necessary to replace  (or flush ) some of the cache buffers to make space available for the new item (see Section 20.2.4). The entries in the DBMS cache directory hold additional information relevant to buffer management.\n",
      "\n",
      "Associated with each buffer in the cache is a dirty bit , which can be included in the directory entry to indicate whether or not the buffer has been modified. When a page is first read from the database disk into a cache buffer, a new entry is inserted in the cache directory with the new disk page address, and the dirty bit is set to 0 (zero). As soon as the buffer is modified, the dirty bit for the corre-sponding directory entry is set to 1 (one).\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional information, such as the trans-action id(s) of the transaction(s) that modified the buffer, are also kept in the directory. When the buffer contents are replaced (flushed) from the cache, the con-tents must first be written back to the corresponding disk page only if its dirty bit is 1 . Another bit, called the pin-unpin  bit, is also needed—a page in the cache is pinned (bit value 1 (one)) if it cannot be written back to disk as yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the recov-ery protocol may restrict certain buffer pages from being written back to the disk until the transactions that changed this buffer have committed. Two main strategies can be employed when flushing a modified buffer back to disk. The first strategy, known as in-place updating , writes the buffer to the same origi- nal disk location,  thus overwriting the old value of any changed data items on disk. 2 Hence, a single copy of each database disk block is maintained.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second strategy, known as shadowing , writes an updated buffer at a different disk location, so mul- tiple versions of data items can be maintained, but this approach is not typically used in practice. In general, the old value of the data item before updating is called the before image (BFIM) , and the new value after updating is called the after image (AFIM) . If shad- owing is used, both the BFIM and the AFIM can be kept on disk; hence, it is not strictly necessary to maintain a log for recovering.\n",
      "\n",
      "We briefly discuss recovery based on shadowing in Section 22.4.\n",
      "\n",
      "22.1.3  Write-Ahead Logging, Steal/No-Steal, and Force/No-Force When in-place updating is used, it is necessary to use a log for recovery (see Sec- tion 21.2.2). In this case, the recovery mechanism must ensure that the BFIM of the data item is recorded in the appropriate log entry and that the log entry is flushed to disk before the BFIM is overwritten with the AFIM in the database on disk.\n",
      "\n",
      "This process is generally known as write-ahead logging  and is necessary so we can UNDO  the operation if this is required during recovery. Before we can describe a protocol for write-ahead logging, we need to distinguish between two types of log entry information included for a write command: the information needed for UNDO 2In-place updating is used in most systems in practice. 22.1 Recovery Concepts  817 and the information needed for REDO .\n",
      "\n",
      "A REDO -type log entry  includes the new value  (AFIM) of the item written by the operation since this is needed to redo  the effect of the operation from the log (by setting the item value in the database on disk to its AFIM). The UNDO -type log entries  include the old value  (BFIM) of the item since this is needed to undo  the effect of the operation from the log (by setting the item value in the database back to its BFIM).\n",
      "\n",
      "In an UNDO/REDO  algorithm, both BFIM and AFIM are recorded into a single log entry. Additionally, when cascading rollback (see Section 22.1.5) is possible, read_item  entries in the log are considered to be UNDO -type entries. As mentioned, the DBMS cache holds the cached database disk blocks in main memory buffers. The DBMS cache includes not only data file blocks , but also index file blocks  and log file blocks  from the disk.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a log record is written, it is stored in the current log buffer in the DBMS cache. The log is simply a sequential (append-only) disk file, and the DBMS cache may contain several log blocks in main mem-ory buffers (typically, the last n log blocks of the log file). When an update to a data block—stored in the DBMS cache—is made, an associated log record is written to the last log buffer in the DBMS cache.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the write-ahead logging approach, the log buffers (blocks) that contain the associated log records for a particular data block update must first be written to disk  before the data block itself can be written back to disk from its main memory buffer. Standard DBMS recovery terminology includes the terms steal/no-steal  and force/no-force , which specify the rules that govern when  a page from the database cache can be written to disk: 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a cache buffer page updated by a transaction cannot  be written to disk before the transaction commits, the recovery method is called a no-steal approach . The pin-unpin bit will be set to 1 (pin) to indicate that a cache buffer cannot be written back to disk. On the other hand, if the recovery protocol allows writing an updated buffer before  the transaction commits, it is called steal .\n",
      "\n",
      "Steal is used when the DBMS cache (buffer) manager needs a buffer frame for another transaction and the buffer manager replaces an existing page that had been updated but whose transaction has not committed. The no-steal rule  means that UNDO  will never be needed during recovery, since a committed transac- tion will not have any of its updates on disk before it commits. 2. If all pages updated by a transaction are immediately written to disk before the transaction commits, the recovery approach is called a force approach . Otherwise, it is called no-force .\n",
      "\n",
      "The force rule  means that REDO  will never be needed during recovery, since any committed transaction will have all its updates on disk before it is committed. The deferred update ( NO-UNDO ) recovery scheme discussed in Section 22.2 follows a no-steal  approach. However, typical database systems employ a steal/no-force (UNDO/REDO) strategy. The advantage of steal  is that it avoids the need for a very large buffer space to store all updated pages in memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The advantage of no-force is that an updated page of a committed transaction may still be in the buffer when 818 Chapter 22 Database Recovery Techniques another transaction needs to update it, thus eliminating the I/O cost to write that page multiple times to disk and possibly having to read it again from disk. This may provide a substantial saving in the number of disk I/O operations when a specific page is updated heavily by multiple transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "To permit recovery when in-place updating is used, the appropriate entries required for recovery must be permanently recorded in the log on disk before changes are applied to the database. For example, consider the following write-ahead logging (WAL)  protocol for a recovery algorithm that requires both UNDO  and REDO : 1. The before image of an item cannot be overwritten by its after image in the database on disk until all UNDO -type log entries for the updating transaction— up to this point—have been force-written to disk. 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "The commit operation of a transaction cannot be completed until all the REDO -type and UNDO -type log records for that transaction have been force- written to disk. To facilitate the recovery process, the DBMS recovery subsystem may need to maintain a number of lists related to the transactions being processed in the system. These include a list for active transactions  that have started but not committed as yet, and they may also include lists of all committed  and aborted transactions since the last checkpoint (see the next section). Maintaining these lists makes the recovery process more efficient.\n",

      "\n",
      "As a consequence of this, all transactions that have their [commit,  T ] entries in the log before a [checkpoint]  entry do not need to have their WRITE  operations redone  in case of a system crash, since all their updates will be recorded in the database on disk during checkpointing. As part of checkpointing, the list of transaction ids for active transactions at the time of the checkpoint is included in the checkpoint record, so that these transactions can be easily identified during recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recovery manager of a DBMS must decide at what intervals to take a check- point. The interval may be measured in time—say, every m minutes—or in the number t of committed transactions since the last checkpoint, where the values of m or t are system parameters. Taking a checkpoint consists of the following actions: 1. Suspend execution of transactions temporarily. 2. Force-write all main memory buffers that have been modified to disk.\n",

Resume executing transactions.\n",

      "As a consequence of step 2, a checkpoint record in the log may also include addi- tional information, such as a list of active transaction ids, and the locations (addresses) of the first and most recent (last) records in the log for each active transaction. This can facilitate undoing transaction operations in the event that a transaction must be rolled back. The time needed to force-write all modified memory buffers may delay transaction processing because of step 1, which is not acceptable in practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "To overcome this, it is common to use a technique called fuzzy checkpointing . In this technique, the system can resume transaction processing after a [begin_checkpoint]  record is writ- ten to the log without having to wait for step 2 to finish. When step 2 is completed, an [end_checkpoint, … ]  record is written in the log with the relevant information collected during checkpointing. However, until step 2 is completed, the previous checkpoint record should remain valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "To accomplish this, the system maintains a file on disk that contains a pointer to the valid checkpoint, which continues to point to the previous checkpoint record in the log. Once step 2 is concluded, that pointer is changed to point to the new checkpoint in the log.\n",

      "22.1.5 Transaction Rollback and Cascading Rollback If a transaction fails for whatever reason after updating the database, but before the transaction commits, it may be necessary to roll back  the transaction. If any data item values have been changed by the transaction and written to the database on disk, they must be restored to their previous values (BFIMs). The undo-type log entries are used to restore the old values of data items that must be rolled back.\n",

Similarly, once S is rolled back, any transaction R that has read the value of some data item Y written by S must also be rolled back; and so on. This phenomenon is called cascading rollback , and it can occur when the recovery protocol ensures recoverable  schedules but does not ensure strict  or cascadeless  schedules (see Section 20.4.2).\n",

If a transaction fails before completion, we may not want the user to get these reports, since the transaction has failed to complete. If such erroneous reports are produced, part of the recovery process would have to inform the user that these reports are wrong, since the user may take an action that is based on these reports and that affects the database.\n",

After the transaction reaches its commit point and the log is force-written to disk, the updates are recorded in the database.\n",

For multiuser systems with concurrency control, the concurrency control and recovery processes are interrelated.\n",

If a transaction is aborted for any reason (say, by the deadlock detection method), it is simply resubmitted, since it has not changed the database on disk.\n",

Additionally, it may require excessive buffer space to hold all updated items until the transactions commit. The method’s main benefit is that transaction opera-tions never need to be undone,  for two reasons: 1. A transaction does not record any changes in the database on disk until after it reaches its commit point—that is, until it completes its execution success-fully.\n",

Shadow paging considers the database to be made up of a number of fixed-size disk pages (or disk blocks)—say, n—for recovery purposes.

The shadow directory is then saved on disk while the current directory is used by the transaction. During transaction execution, the shadow directory is never  modified.\n",
      "\n",

Instead, the new page is writ- ten elsewhere—on some previously unused disk block. The current directory entry is modified to point to the new disk block, whereas the shadow directory is not modified and continues to point to the old unmodified disk block. Figure 22.4 illus-trates the concepts of shadow and current directories. For pages updated by the transaction, two versions are kept.\n",

      "22.5 The ARIES Recovery Algorithm  827 To recover from a failure during transaction execution, it is sufficient to free the modified database pages and to discard the current directory. The state of the data-base before transaction execution is available through the shadow directory, and that state is recovered by reinstating the shadow directory. The database thus is returned to its state prior to the transaction that was executing when the crash occurred, and any modified pages are discarded. Committing a transaction corre-sponds to discarding the previous shadow directory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since recovery involves nei-ther undoing nor redoing data items, this technique can be categorized as a NO-UNDO/NO-REDO  technique for recovery. In a multiuser environment with concurrent transactions, logs and checkpoints must be incorporated into the shadow paging technique. One disadvantage of shadow pag-ing is that the updated database pages change location on disk. This makes it difficult to keep related database pages close together on disk without complex storage man-agement strategies.\n",

      "Furthermore, if the directory is large, the overhead of writing shadow directories to disk as transactions commit is significant. A further complica-tion is how to handle garbage collection  when a transaction commits. The old pages referenced by the shadow directory that have been updated must be released and added to a list of free pages for future use. These pages are no longer needed after the transaction commits. Another issue is that the operation to migrate between current and shadow directories must be implemented as an atomic operation.\n",

      "22.5 The ARIES Recovery Algorithm   We now describe the ARIES algorithm as an example of a recovery algorithm used in database systems. It is used in many relational database-related products of IBM. ARIES uses a steal/no-force approach for writing, and it is based on three concepts: write-ahead logging, repeating history during redo, and logging changes during undo. We discussed write-ahead logging in Section 22.1.3.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second concept, repeating history , means that ARIES will retrace all actions of the database system prior to the crash to reconstruct the database state when the crash occurred. Trans- actions that were uncommitted at the time of the crash (active transactions) are undone. The third concept, logging during undo , will prevent ARIES from repeat- ing the completed undo operations if a failure occurs during recovery, which causes a restart of the recovery process. The ARIES recovery procedure consists of three main steps: analysis, REDO , and UNDO .\n",
      "\n",
      "The analysis step  identifies the dirty (updated) pages in the buffer6 and the set of transactions active at the time of the crash. The appropriate point in the log where the REDO  operation should start is also determined. The REDO  phase  actu- ally reapplies updates from the log to the database. Generally, the REDO  operation is applied only to committed transactions. However, this is not the case in ARIES. 6The actual buffers may be lost during a crash, since they are in main memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional tables stored in the log during checkpointing (Dirty Page Table, Transaction Table) allow ARIES to identify this information (as discussed later in this section).828 Chapter 22 Database Recovery Techniques Certain information in the ARIES log will provide the start point for REDO , from which REDO  operations are applied until the end of the log is reached.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, information stored by ARIES and in the data pages will allow ARIES to determine whether the operation to be redone has actually been applied to the database and therefore does not need to be reapplied. Thus, only the necessary REDO operations are applied during recovery. Finally, during the UNDO  phase , the log is scanned backward and the operations of transactions that were active at the time of the crash are undone in reverse order. The information needed for ARIES to accomplish its recovery procedure includes the log, the Transaction Table, and the Dirty Page Table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, checkpointing is used. These tables are maintained by the transaction manager and written to the log during checkpointing. In ARIES, every log record has an associated log sequence number (LSN)  that is monotonically increasing and indicates the address of the log record on disk. Each LSN corresponds to a specific change  (action) of some transaction. Also, each data page will store the LSN of the latest log record corresponding to a change for that page.\n",
      "\n",
      "A log record is written for any of the following actions: updating a page (write), committing a transaction (commit), aborting a transaction (abort), undo-ing an update (undo), and ending a transaction (end). The need for including the first three actions in the log has been discussed, but the last two need some explana-tion. When an update is undone, a compensation log record  is written in the log so that the undo does not have to be repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a transaction ends, whether by committing or aborting, an end log record  is written. Common fields in all log records include the previous LSN for that transaction, the transaction ID, and the type of log record. The previous LSN is important because it links the log records (in reverse order) for each transaction. For an update (write) action, additional fields in the log record include the page ID for the page that con-tains the item, the length of the updated item, its offset from the beginning of the page, the before image of the item, and its after image.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the log, two tables are needed for efficient recovery: the Transaction Table  and the Dirty Page Table , which are maintained by the transaction manager. When a crash occurs, these tables are rebuilt in the analysis phase of recovery. The Transaction Table contains an entry for each active transaction,  with information such as the transaction ID, transaction status, and the LSN of the most recent log record for the transaction. The Dirty Page Table contains an entry for each dirty page in the DBMS cache, which includes the page ID and the LSN corresponding to the earliest update to that page.\n",
      "\n",
      "Checkpointing  in ARIES consists of the following: writing a begin_checkpoint record to the log, writing an end_checkpoint  record to the log, and writing the LSN of the begin_checkpoint  record to a special file. This special file is accessed during recovery to locate the last checkpoint information. With the end_checkpoint  record, the contents of both the Transaction Table and Dirty Page Table are appended to the end of the log.\n",

After a crash, the ARIES recovery manager takes over. Information from the last checkpoint is first accessed through the special file. The analysis phase starts at the begin_checkpoint  record and proceeds to the end of the log. When the end_checkpoint  record is encountered, the Transaction Table and Dirty Page Table are accessed (recall that these tables were written in the log during checkpointing).\n",

      "During analysis, the log records being analyzed may cause modifications to these two tables. For instance, if an end log record was encountered for a transaction T in the Transaction Table, then the entry for T is deleted from that table. If some other type of log record is encountered for a transaction T′, then an entry for T′ is inserted into the Transaction Table, if not already present, and the last LSN field is modified.\n",

      "If the log record corresponds to a change for page P, then an entry would be made for page P (if not present in the table) and the associated LSN field would be modified. When the analysis phase is complete, the necessary information for REDO  and UNDO  has been compiled in the tables. The REDO  phase  follows next. To reduce the amount of unnecessary work, ARIES starts redoing at a point in the log where it knows (for sure) that previous changes to dirty pages have already been applied to the database on disk.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can determine this by finding the smallest LSN, M, of all the dirty pages in the Dirty Page Table, which indicates the log position where ARIES needs to start the REDO  phase. Any changes corresponding to an LSN < M, for redoable transactions, must have already been propagated to disk or already been overwritten in the buffer; otherwise, those dirty pages with that LSN would be in the buffer (and the Dirty Page Table). So, REDO  starts at the log record with LSN = M and scans forward to the end of the log.\n",
      "\n",
      "For each change recorded in the log, the REDO  algorithm would verify whether or not the change has to be reapplied. For example, if a change recorded in the log pertains to page P that is not in the Dirty Page Table, then this change is already on disk and does not need to be reapplied. Or, if a change recorded in the log (with LSN = N, say) pertains to page P and the Dirty Page Table contains an entry for P with LSN greater than N, then the change is already present.\n",

      "If neither of these two conditions holds, page P is read from disk and the LSN stored on that page, LSN( P), is compared with N. If N < LSN( P), then the change has been applied and the page does not need to be rewritten to disk. Once the REDO  phase is finished, the database is in the exact state that it was in when the crash occurred. The set of active transactions—called the undo_set —has been identified in the Transaction Table during the analysis phase.\n",

      "22.6 Recovery in Multidatabase Systems So far, we have implicitly assumed that a transaction accesses a single database. In some cases, a single transaction, called a multidatabase transaction , may require access to multiple databases. These databases may even be stored on different types of DBMSs; for example, some DBMSs may be relational, whereas others are object- oriented, hierarchical, or network DBMSs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In such a case, each DBMS involved in the multidatabase transaction may have its own recovery technique and transaction man- ager separate from those of the other DBMSs. This situation is somewhat similar to the case of a distributed database management system (see Chapter 23), where parts of the database reside at different sites that are connected by a communication network. To maintain the atomicity of a multidatabase transaction, it is necessary to have a two-level recovery mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "A global recovery manager , or coordinator , is needed to maintain information needed for recovery, in addition to the local recov- ery managers and the information they maintain (log, tables). The coordinator usu-ally follows a protocol called the two-phase commit protocol , whose two phases can be stated as follows: ■Phase 1. When all participating databases signal the coordinator that the part of the multidatabase transaction involving each has concluded, the coordinator sends a message prepare for commit  to each participant to get ready for committing the transaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each participating database receiving that message will force-write all log records and needed information for local recovery to disk and then send a ready to commit  or OK signal to the coordinator. If the force-writing to disk fails or the local transaction cannot commit for some reason, the participating database sends a cannot commit or not OK  signal to the coordinator. If the coordinator does not receive a reply from the database within a certain time out interval, it assumes a not OK response. ■Phase 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "If all participating databases reply OK, and the coordinator’s vote is also OK, the transaction is successful, and the coordinator sends a commit signal for the transaction to the participating databases. Because all the local effects of the transaction and information needed for local recovery have 832 Chapter 22 Database Recovery Techniques been recorded in the logs of the participating databases, local recovery from failure is now possible. Each participating database completes transaction commit by writing a [commit]  entry for the transaction in the log and perma- nently updating the database if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, if one or more of the participating databases or the coordinator have a not OK  response, the transaction has failed, and the coordinator sends a message to roll back  or UNDO  the local effect of the transaction to each participating database. This is done by undoing the local transaction operations, using the log. The net effect of the two-phase commit protocol is that either all participating data- bases commit the effect of the transaction or none of them do.\n",
      "\n",
      "In case any of the participants—or the coordinator—fails, it is always possible to recover to a state where either the transaction is committed or it is rolled back. A failure during or before phase 1 usually requires the transaction to be rolled back, whereas a failure during phase 2 means that a successful transaction can recover and commit.\n",
      "\n",
      "22.7  Database Backup and Recovery   from Catastrophic Failures So far, all the techniques we have discussed apply to noncatastrophic failures. A key assumption has been that the system log is maintained on the disk and is not lost as a result of the failure. Similarly, the shadow directory must be stored on disk to allow recovery when shadow paging is used. The recovery techniques we have dis- cussed use the entries in the system log or the shadow directory to recover from failure by bringing the database back to a consistent state.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recovery manager of a DBMS must also be equipped to handle more catastrophic failures such as disk crashes. The main technique used to handle such crashes is a database backup , in which the whole database and the log are periodically copied onto a cheap storage medium such as magnetic tapes or other large capacity offline storage devices. In case of a catastrophic system failure, the latest backup copy can be reloaded from the tape to the disk, and the system can be restarted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data from critical applications such as banking, insurance, stock market, and other databases is periodically backed up in its entirety and moved to physically separate safe locations. Subterranean storage vaults have been used to protect such data from flood, storm, earthquake, or fire damage. Events like the 9/11 terrorist attack in New York (in 2001) and the Katrina hurricane disaster in New Orleans (in 2005) have created a greater awareness of disaster recovery of critical databases .\n",
      "\n",
      "To avoid losing all the effects of transactions that have been executed since the last backup, it is customary to back up the system log at more frequent intervals than full database backup by periodically copying it to magnetic tape. The system log is usu-ally substantially smaller than the database itself and hence can be backed up more frequently. Therefore, users do not lose all transactions they have performed since the last database backup.\n",
      "\n",
      "All committed transactions recorded in the portion of the system log that has been backed up to tape can have their effect on the database  22.8 Summary  833 redone. A new log is started after each database backup. Hence, to recover from disk failure, the database is first recreated on disk from its latest backup copy on tape. Fol-lowing that, the effects of all the committed transactions whose operations have been recorded in the backed-up copies of the system log are reconstructed.\n",
      "\n",
      "22.8 Summary   In this chapter, we discussed the techniques for recovery from transaction failures. The main goal of recovery is to ensure the atomicity property of a transaction. If a transaction fails before completing its execution, the recovery mechanism has to make sure that the transaction has no lasting effects on the database. First in Sec-tion 22.1 we gave an informal outline for a recovery process, and then we discussed system concepts for recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "These included a discussion of caching, in-place updating versus shadowing, before and after images of a data item, UNDO  versus REDO  recovery operations, steal/no-steal and force/no-force policies, system check- pointing, and the write-ahead logging protocol. Next we discussed two different approaches to recovery: deferred update (Sec- tion  22.2) and immediate update (Section 22.3). Deferred update techniques  postpone any actual updating of the database on disk until a transaction reaches its commit point.\n",
      "\n",
      "The transaction force-writes the log to disk before recording the updates in the database. This approach, when used with certain concurrency  control methods, is designed never to require transaction rollback, and recovery simply consists of redoing the operations of transactions committed after the last checkpoint from the log. The disadvantage is that too much buffer space may be needed, since updates are kept in the buffers and are not applied to disk until a trans action commits. Deferred update can lead to a recovery algorithm known as NO-UNDO /REDO .\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediate update techniques may apply changes to the database on disk before the transaction reaches a successful conclusion. Any changes applied to the database must first be recorded in the log and force-written to disk so that these operations can be undone if necessary. We also gave an overview of a recovery algorithm for immediate update known as UNDO /REDO . Another algorithm, known as UNDO /NO-REDO , can also be developed for immediate update if all trans- action actions are recorded in the database before commit.\n",
      "\n",
      "We discussed the shadow paging technique for recovery in Section 22.4, which keeps track of old database pages by using a shadow directory. This technique, which is classified as NO-UNDO/NO-REDO , does not require a log in single-user sys- tems but still needs the log for multiuser systems. We also presented ARIES in Sec- tion 22.5, which is a specific recovery scheme used in many of IBM’s relational database products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in Section 22.6 we discussed the two-phase commit proto- col, which is used for recovery from failures involving multidatabase transactions. Finally, we discussed recovery from catastrophic failures in Section 22.7, which is typically done by backing up the database and the log to tape. The log can be backed up more frequently than the database, and the backup log can be used to redo oper-ations starting from the last database backup.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this section, we discuss techniques that are used to break up the database into logical units, called fragments , which may be assigned for storage at the various nodes. We also discuss the use of data replication , which permits certain data to be stored in more than one site to increase availability and reliability; and the process of allocating  fragments—or replicas of fragments—for storage at the various nodes. These techniques are used during the process of distributed database design .\n",
      "\n",
      "The information concerning data fragmentation, allocation, and replication is stored in a global directory  that is accessed by the DDBS applications as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "23.2.1 Data Fragmentation and Sharding In a DDB, decisions must be made regarding which site should be used to store which portions of the database. For now, we will assume that there is no replication ; that is, each relation—or portion of a relation—is stored at one site only. We dis-cuss replication and its effects later in this section. We also use the terminology of relational databases, but similar concepts apply to other data models.\n",
      "\n",
      "We assume that we are starting with a relational database schema and must decide on how to distribute the relations over the various sites. To illustrate our discussion, we use the relational database schema shown in Figure 5.5. Before we decide on how to distribute the data, we must determine the logical units  of the database that are to be distributed. The simplest logical units are the relations themselves; that is, each whole  relation is to be stored at a particular site.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our exam- ple, we must decide on a site to store each of the relations EMPLOYEE , DEPARTMENT , PROJECT , WORKS_ON , and DEPENDENT  in Figure 5.5. In many cases, however, a relation can be divided into smaller logical units for distribution. For example, consider the company database shown in Figure 5.6, and assume there are three computer sites—one for each department in the company. 1 We may want to store the database information relating to each department at the computer site for that department.\n",
      "\n",
      "A technique called horizontal fragmentation  or sharding  can be used to partition each relation by department. Horizontal Fragmentation (Sharding). A horizontal fragment  or shard  of a relation is a subset of the tuples in that relation. The tuples that belong to the horizontal fragment can be specified by a condition on one or more attributes of the relation, or by some other mechanism. Often, only a single attribute is involved in the condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we may define three horizontal fragments on the EMPLOYEE  relation in Figure 5.6 with the following conditions: ( Dno = 5), ( Dno = 4), and ( Dno = 1)—each 1Of course, in an actual situation, there will be many more tuples in the relation than those shown in Figure 5.6.848 Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts fragment contains the EMPLOYEE  tuples working for a particular department.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sim- ilarly, we may define three horizontal fragments for the PROJECT  relation, with the conditions ( Dnum  = 5), ( Dnum  = 4), and ( Dnum  = 1)—each fragment contains the PROJECT  tuples controlled by a particular department. Horizontal fragmentation divides a relation horizontally  by grouping rows to create subsets of tuples, where each subset has a certain logical meaning. These fragments can then be assigned to different sites (nodes) in the distributed system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Derived horizontal  fragmentation applies the partitioning of a primary relation ( DEPARTMENT  in our example) to other secondary relations ( EMPLOYEE  and PROJECT  in our example), which are related to the primary via a foreign key. Thus, related data between the primary and the secondary relations gets fragmented in the same way. Vertical Fragmentation. Each site may not need all the attributes of a relation, which would indicate the need for a different type of fragmentation. Vertical fragmentation  divides a relation “vertically” by columns.\n",
      "\n",
      "A vertical fragment  of a relation keeps only certain attributes of the relation. For example, we may want to fragment the EMPLOYEE  relation into two vertical fragments. The first fragment includes personal information— Name , Bdate , Address , and Sex—and the second includes work-related information— Ssn, Salary , Super_ssn , and Dno. This vertical fragmentation is not quite proper, because if the two fragments are stored sepa- rately, we cannot put the original employee tuples back together since there is no common attribute  between the two fragments.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is necessary to include the primary key or some unique key attribute in every  vertical fragment so that the full relation can be reconstructed from the fragments. Hence, we must add the Ssn attribute to the personal information fragment. Notice that each horizontal fragment on a relation R can be specified in the rela- tional algebra by a σCi(R) (select) operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "A set of horizontal fragments whose conditions C1, C2, … , Cn include all the tuples in R—that is, every tuple in R satis- fies ( C1 OR C2 OR … OR Cn)—is called a complete horizontal fragmentation  of R. In many cases a complete horizontal fragmentation is also disjoint ; that is, no tuple in R satisfies ( Ci AND  Cj) for any i ≠ j. Our two earlier examples of horizontal frag- mentation for the EMPLOYEE  and PROJECT  relations were both complete and dis- joint.\n",
      "\n",
      "To reconstruct the relation R from a complete  horizontal fragmentation, we need to apply the UNION  operation to the fragments. A vertical fragment on a relation R can be specified by a πLi(R) operation in the relational algebra.\n",
      "\n",
      "A set of vertical fragments whose projection lists L1, L2, … , Ln include all the attributes in R but share only the primary key attribute of R is called a complete vertical fragmentation  of R. In this case the projection lists satisfy the following two conditions: ■L1 ∪ L2 ∪ … ∪ Ln = ATTRS (R) ■Li ∩ Lj = PK(R) for any i ≠ j, where ATTRS (R) is the set of attributes of R and PK(R) is the primary key of R To reconstruct the relation R from a complete  vertical fragmentation, we apply the OUTER UNION  operation to the vertical fragments (assuming no horizontal  23.2 Data Fragmentation, Replication, and Allocation Techniques for Distributed Database Design  849 fragmentation is used).\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that we could also apply a FULL OUTER JOIN  opera- tion and get the same result for a complete vertical fragmentation, even when some horizontal fragmentation may also have been applied. The two vertical frag-ments of the EMPLOYEE  relation with projection lists L1 = {Ssn, Name , Bdate , Address , Sex} and L2 = {Ssn, Salary , Super_ssn , Dno} constitute a complete vertical fragmentation of EMPLOYEE .\n",
      "\n",
      "Two horizontal fragments that are neither complete nor disjoint are those defined on the EMPLOYEE  relation in Figure 5.5 by the conditions ( Salary  > 50000) and ( Dno = 4); they may not include all EMPLOYEE  tuples, and they may include common tuples. Two vertical fragments that are not complete are those defined by the attribute lists L 1 = {Name , Address } and L2 = {Ssn, Name , Salary }; these lists violate both conditions of a complete vertical fragmentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixed (Hybrid) Fragmentation. We can intermix the two types of fragmenta- tion, yielding a mixed fragmentation . For example, we may combine the horizon- tal and vertical fragmentations of the EMPLOYEE  relation given earlier into a mixed fragmentation that includes six fragments. In this case, the original relation can be reconstructed by applying UNION  and OUTER UNION  (or OUTER JOIN ) operations in the appropriate order.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, a fragment  of a relation R can be specified by a SELECT-PROJECT  combination of operations πL(σC(R)). If C = TRUE  (that is, all tuples are selected) and L ≠ ATTRS (R), we get a vertical fragment, and if C ≠ TRUE  and L = ATTRS (R), we get a horizontal fragment. Finally, if C ≠ TRUE  and L ≠ ATTRS (R), we get a mixed fragment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that a relation can itself be considered a fragment with C = TRUE  and L = ATTRS (R). In the following discussion, the term fragment  is used to refer to a relation or to any of the preceding types of fragments. A fragmentation schema  of a database is a definition of a set of fragments that includes all attributes and tuples in the database and satisfies the condition that the whole data- base can be reconstructed from the fragments by applying some sequence of OUTER UNION  (or OUTER JOIN ) and UNION  operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also sometimes useful— although not necessary—to have all the fragments be disjoint except for the repetition of pri-mary keys among vertical (or mixed) fragments. In the latter case, all replication and distribution of fragments is clearly specified at a subsequent stage, separately from fragmentation. An allocation schema  describes the allocation of fragments to nodes (sites) of the DDBS; hence, it is a mapping that specifies for each fragment the site(s) at which it is stored. If a fragment is stored at more than one site, it is said to be replicated .\n",
      "\n",
      "We discuss data replication and allocation next.\n",
      "\n",
      "23.2.2 Data Replication and Allocation Replication is useful in improving the availability of data. The most extreme case is replication of the whole database  at every site in the distributed system, thus creat- ing a fully replicated distributed database . This can improve availability remark- ably because the system can continue to operate as long as at least one site is up.\n",
      "\n",
      "It 850 Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts also improves performance of retrieval (read performance) for global queries because the results of such queries can be obtained locally from any one site; hence, a retrieval query can be processed at the local site where it is submitted, if that site includes a server module. The disadvantage of full replication is that it can slow down update operations (write performance) drastically, since a single logical update must be performed on every copy  of the database to keep the copies consis- tent.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is especially true if many copies of the database exist. Full replication makes the concurrency control and recovery techniques more expensive than they would be if there was no replication, as we will see in Section 23.3. The other extreme from full replication involves having no replication —that is, each fragment is stored at exactly one site. In this case, all fragments must be  dis- joint, except for the repetition of primary keys among vertical (or mixed) frag-ments. This is also called nonredundant allocation .\n",
      "\n",
      "Between these two extremes, we have a wide spectrum of partial replication  of the data—that is, some fragments of the database may be replicated whereas oth-ers may not. The number of copies of each fragment can range from one up to the total number of sites in the distributed system.\n",
      "\n",
      "A special case of partial repli-cation is occurring heavily in applications where mobile workers—such as sales forces, financial planners, and claims adjustors—carry partially replicated data-bases with them on laptops and PDAs and synchronize them periodically with the server database. A description of the replication of fragments is sometimes called a replication schema . Each fragment—or each copy of a fragment—must be assigned to a particular site in the distributed system. This process is called data distribution  (or data  allocation ).\n",
      "\n",
      "The choice of sites and the degree of replication depend on the performance and availability goals of the system and on the types and frequencies of transactions submitted at each site. For example, if high availability is required, transactions can be submitted at any site, and most transactions are retrieval only, a fully replicated database is a good choice. However, if certain transactions that access particular parts of the database are mostly submitted at a particular site, the corresponding set of fragments can be allocated at that site only. Data that is accessed at multiple sites can be replicated at those sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "If many updates are performed, it may be useful to limit replication. Finding an optimal or even a good solution to distributed data allocation is a complex optimization problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "23.2.3 Example of Fragmentation, Allocation, and Replication We now consider an example of fragmenting and distributing the company data-base in Figures 5.5 and  5.6. Suppose that the company has three computer sites— one for each current department. Sites 2 and 3 are for departments 5 and 4, respectively. At each of these sites, we expect frequent access to the EMPLOYEE  and PROJECT  information for the employees who work in that department  and the projects controlled by that department.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, we assume that these sites mainly access the Name , Ssn, Salary , and Super_ssn  attributes of EMPLOYEE . Site 1 is used  23.2 Data Fragmentation, Replication, and Allocation Techniques for Distributed Database Design  851 by company headquarters and accesses all employee and project information regu- larly, in addition to keeping track of DEPENDENT  information for insurance purposes. According to these requirements, the whole database in Figure 5.6 can be stored at site 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine the fragments to be replicated at sites 2 and 3, first we can horizontally fragment DEPARTMENT  by its key Dnumber . Then we apply derived fragmentation to the EMPLOYEE , PROJECT , and DEPT_LOCATIONS  relations based on their foreign keys for department number—called Dno, Dnum , and Dnumber , respectively, in Figure 5.5. We can vertically fragment the resulting EMPLOYEE fragments to include only the attributes { Name , Ssn, Salary , Super_ssn , Dno}.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 23.2 shows the mixed fragments EMPD_5  and EMPD_4 , which include the EMPLOYEE  tuples satisfying the conditions Dno = 5 and Dno = 4, respectively. The horizontal fragments of PROJECT , DEPARTMENT , and DEPT_LOCATIONS  are similarly fragmented by department number. All these fragments—stored at sites 2 and 3—are replicated because they are also stored at headquarters—site 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must now fragment the WORKS_ON  relation and decide which fragments of WORKS_ON  to store at sites 2 and 3. We are confronted with the problem that no attribute of WORKS_ON  directly indicates the department to which each tuple belongs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, each tuple in WORKS_ON  relates an employee e to a project P. We could fragment WORKS_ON  based on the department D in which e works or based on the department D′ that controls P. Fragmentation becomes easy if we have a constraint stating that D = D′ for all WORKS_ON  tuples—that is, if employees can work only on projects controlled by the department they work for. However, there is no such constraint in our database in Figure 5.6.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the WORKS_ON tuple <333445555, 10, 10.0> relates an employee who works for department 5 with a project controlled by department 4. In this case, we could fragment WORKS_ON based on the department in which the employee works (which is expressed by the condition C) and then fragment further based on the department that controls the projects that employee is working on, as shown in Figure 23.3.\n",

      "In Figure 23.3, the union of fragments G 1, G2, and G3 gives all WORKS_ON  tuples for employees who work for department 5. Similarly, the union of fragments G4, G5, and G6 gives all WORKS_ON  tuples for employees who work for department 4. On the other hand, the union of fragments G1, G4, and G7 gives all WORKS_ON  tuples for projects controlled by department 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "The condition for each of the fragments G1 through G9 is shown in Figure 23.3. The relations that represent M:N relationships, such as WORKS_ON , often have several possible logical fragmentations. In our distri- bution in Figure 23.2, we choose to include all fragments that can be joined to either an EMPLOYEE  tuple or a PROJECT  tuple at sites 2 and 3.\n",

      "Hence, we place the union of fragments G1, G2, G3, G4, and G7 at site 2 and the union of fragments G4, G5, G6, G2, and G8 at site 3. Notice that fragments G2 and G4 are replicated at both sites. This allo- cation strategy permits the join between the local EMPLOYEE  or PROJECT  fragments at site 2 or site 3 and the local WORKS_ON  fragment to be performed completely locally.\n",

      "23.3  Overview of Concurrency Control   and Recovery in Distributed Databases For concurrency control and recovery purposes, numerous problems arise in a dis- tributed DBMS environment that are not encountered in a centralized DBMS envi-ronment. These include the following: ■Dealing with multiple copies  of the data items. The concurrency control method is responsible for maintaining consistency among these copies. The recovery method is responsible for making a copy consistent with other cop-ies if the site on which the copy is stored fails and recovers later.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Failure of individual sites. The DDBMS should continue to operate with its running sites, if possible, when one or more individual sites fail. When a site recovers, its local database must be brought up-to-date with the rest of the sites before it rejoins the system. ■Failure of communication links. The system must be able to deal with the failure of one or more of the communication links that connect the sites. An extreme case of this problem is that network partitioning  may occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "This breaks up the sites into two or more partitions, where the sites within each partition can communicate only with one another and not with sites in other partitions. ■Distributed commit. Problems can arise with committing a transaction that is accessing databases stored on multiple sites if some sites fail during the commit process. The two-phase commit protocol  (see Section 21.6) is often used to deal with this problem. ■Distributed deadlock. Deadlock may occur among several sites, so techniques for dealing with deadlocks must be extended to take this into account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Distributed concurrency control and recovery techniques must deal with these and other problems. In the following subsections, we review some of the tech-niques that have been suggested to deal with recovery and concurrency control in DDBMSs.\n",
      "\n",
      "23.3.1  Distributed Concurrency Control Based on a Distinguished Copy of a Data Item To deal with replicated data items in a distributed database, a number of concur- rency control methods have been proposed that extend the concurrency control techniques that are used in centralized databases. We discuss these techniques in the context of extending centralized locking. Similar extensions apply to other con- currency control techniques. The idea is to designate a particular copy  of each data item as a distinguished copy .\n",
      "\n",
      "The locks for this data item are associated with the distinguished copy,  and all locking and unlocking requests are sent to the site that contains that copy. 23.3 Overview of Concurrency Control and Recovery in Distributed Databases  855 A number of different methods are based on this idea, but they differ in their method of choosing the distinguished copies. In the primary site technique , all distinguished copies are kept at the same site. A modification of this approach is the primary site with a backup site .\n",
      "\n",
      "Another approach is the primary copy method, where the distinguished copies of the various data items can be stored in different sites. A site that includes a distinguished copy of a data item basically acts as the coordinator site  for concurrency control on that item. We discuss these techniques next. Primary Site Technique. In this method, a single primary site  is designated to be the coordinator site  for all database items. Hence, all locks are kept at that site, and all requests for locking or unlocking are sent there.\n",
      "\n",
      "This method is thus an exten- sion of the centralized locking approach. For example, if all transactions follow the two-phase locking protocol, serializability is guaranteed. The advantage of this approach is that it is a simple extension of the centralized approach and thus is not overly complex. However, it has certain inherent disadvantages. One is that all locking requests are sent to a single site, possibly overloading that site and causing a system bottleneck.\n",
      "\n",
      "A second disadvantage is that failure of the primary site para-lyzes the system, since all locking information is kept at that site. This can limit system reliability and availability. Although all locks are accessed at the primary site, the items themselves can be accessed at any site at which they reside. For example, once a transaction obtains a Read_lock  on a data item from the primary site, it can access any copy of that data item.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, once a transaction obtains a Write_lock  and updates a data item, the DDBMS is respon- sible for updating all copies  of the data item before releasing the lock. Primary Site with Backup Site. This approach addresses the second disadvan- tage of the primary site method by designating a second site to be a backup site . All locking information is maintained at both the primary and the backup sites. In case of primary site failure, the backup site takes over as the primary site, and a new backup site is chosen.\n",
      "\n",
      "This simplifies the process of recovery from failure of the primary site, since the backup site takes over and processing can resume after a new backup site is chosen and the lock status information is copied to that site. It slows down the process of acquiring locks, however, because all lock requests and grant-ing of locks must be recorded at both the primary and the backup sites  before a response is sent to the requesting transaction. The problem of the primary and backup sites becoming overloaded with requests and slowing down the system remains undiminished. Primary Copy Technique.\n",
      "\n",
      "This method attempts to distribute the load of lock coordination among various sites by having the distinguished copies of different data items stored at different sites. Failure of one site affects any transactions that are accessing locks on items whose primary copies reside at that site, but other transactions are not affected. This method can also use backup sites to enhance reli-ability and availability.856 Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts Choosing a New Coordinator Site in Case of Failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever a coordina- tor site fails in any of the preceding techniques, the sites that are still running must choose a new coordinator. In the case of the primary site approach with no backup site, all executing transactions must be aborted and restarted in a tedious recovery process. Part of the recovery process involves choosing a new primary site and cre-ating a lock manager process and a record of all lock information at that site.\n",
      "\n",
      "For methods that use backup sites, transaction processing is suspended while the backup site is designated as the new primary site and a new backup site is chosen and is sent copies of all the locking information from the new primary site. If a backup site X is about to become the new primary site, X can choose the new backup site from among the system’s running sites. However, if no backup site existed, or if both the primary and the backup sites are down, a process called election  can be used to choose the new coordinator site.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this process, any site Y that attempts to communicate with the coordinator site repeatedly and fails to do so can assume that the coordinator is down and can start the election process by send-ing a message to all running sites proposing that Y become the new coordinator. As soon as Y receives a majority of yes votes, Y can declare that it is the new coordina- tor. The election algorithm itself is complex, but this is the main idea behind the election method. The algorithm also resolves any attempt by two or more sites to become coordinator at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The references in the Selected Bibliography at the end of this chapter discuss the process in detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "23.3.2 Distributed Concurrency Control Based on Voting The concurrency control methods for replicated items discussed earlier all use the idea of a distinguished copy that maintains the locks for that item. In the voting method , there is no distinguished copy; rather, a lock request is sent to all sites that includes a copy of the data item. Each copy maintains its own lock and can grant or deny the request for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a transaction that requests a lock is granted that lock by a majority  of the copies, it holds the lock and informs all copies  that it has been granted the lock. If a transaction does not receive a majority of votes granting it a lock within a certain time-out period,  it cancels its request and informs all sites of the cancellation. The voting method is considered a truly distributed concurrency control method, since the responsibility for a decision resides with all the sites involved. Simulation studies have shown that voting has higher message traffic among sites than do the distinguished copy methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the algorithm takes into account possible site fail-ures during the voting process, it becomes extremely complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "23.3.3 Distributed Recovery The recovery process in distributed databases is quite involved. We give only a very brief idea of some of the issues here. In some cases it is difficult even to determine whether a site is down without exchanging numerous messages with other sites. For  23.4 Overview of Transaction Management in Distributed Databases  857 example, suppose that site X sends a message to site Y and expects a response from Y but does not receive it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several possible explanations: ■The message was not delivered to Y because of communication failure. ■Site Y is down and could not respond. ■Site Y is running and sent a response, but the response was not delivered. Without additional information or the sending of additional messages, it is difficult to determine what actually happened. Another problem with distributed recovery is distributed commit. When a transac- tion is updating data at several sites, it cannot commit until it is sure that the effect of the transaction on every  site cannot be lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that every site must first have recorded the local effects of the transactions permanently in the local site log on disk. The two-phase commit protocol is often used to ensure the correctness of distributed commit (see Section 21.6).\n",
      "\n",
      "23.4  Overview of Transaction Management in Distributed Databases The global and local transaction management software modules, along with the concurrency control and recovery manager of a DDBMS, collectively guarantee the ACID properties of transactions (see Chapter 20). An additional component called the global transaction manager  is introduced for supporting distributed transactions. The site where the transaction originated can temporarily assume the role of global transaction manager and coordinate the exe- cution of database operations with transaction managers across multiple sites. Transaction managers export their functionality as an interface to the application programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The operations exported by this interface are similar to those covered in Section 20.2.1, namely BEGIN_TRANSACTION , READ  or WRITE , END_TRANSACTION , COMMIT_TRANSACTION , and ROLLBACK  (or ABORT ). The manager stores book- keeping information related to each transaction, such as a unique identifier, origi- nating site, name, and so on. For READ  operations, it returns a local copy if valid and available.\n",
      "\n",
      "For WRITE  operations, it ensures that updates are visible across all sites containing copies (replicas) of the data item. For ABORT  operations, the manager ensures that no effects of the transaction are reflected in any site of the distributed database. For COMMIT  operations, it ensures that the effects of a write are persistently recorded on all databases containing copies of the data item. Atomic termination (COMMIT / ABORT ) of distributed transactions is commonly implemented using the two-phase commit protocol (see Section 22.6).\n",
      "\n",
      "The transaction manager passes to the concurrency controller module the database operations and associated information. The controller is responsible for acquisition and release of associated locks. If the transaction requires access to a locked resource, it is blocked until the lock is acquired. Once the lock is acquired, the oper- ation is sent to the runtime processor, which handles the actual execution of the 858 Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts database operation. Once the operation is completed, locks are released and the transaction manager is updated with the result of the operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "23.4.1 Two-Phase Commit Protocol In Section 22.6, we described the two-phase commit protocol  (2PC ), which requires a global recovery manager , or coordinator , to maintain information needed for recovery, in addition to the local recovery managers and the information they maintain (log, tables). The two-phase commit protocol has certain drawbacks that led to the development of the three-phase commit protocol, which we discuss next.\n",
      "\n",
      "23.4.2 Three-Phase Commit Protocol The biggest drawback of 2PC is that it is a blocking protocol. Failure of the coordi-nator blocks all participating sites, causing them to wait until the coordinator recovers. This can cause performance degradation, especially if participants are holding locks to shared resources. Other types of problems may also occur that make the outcome of the transaction nondeterministic.\n",
      "\n",
      "These problems are solved by the three-phase commit (3PC) protocol, which essen- tially divides the second commit phase into two subphases called prepare-to-commit and commit . The prepare-to-commit phase is used to communicate the result of the vote phase to all participants. If all participants vote yes, then the coordinator instructs them to move into the prepare-to-commit state. The commit subphase is identical to its two-phase counterpart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if the coordinator crashes during this subphase, another participant can see the transaction through to completion. It can simply ask a crashed participant if it received a prepare-to-commit message. If it did not, then it safely assumes to abort. Thus the state of the protocol can be recov-ered irrespective of which participant crashes. Also, by limiting the time required for a transaction to commit or abort to a maximum time-out period, the protocol ensures that a transaction attempting to commit via 3PC releases locks on time-out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main idea is to limit the wait time for participants who have prepared to com- mit and are waiting for a global commit or abort from the coordinator. When a participant receives a precommit message, it knows that the rest of the participants have voted to commit. If a precommit message has not been received, then the par-ticipant will abort and release all locks.\n",
      "\n",
      "23.4.3 Operating System Support for Transaction Management The following are the main benefits of operating system (OS)-supported transaction management: ■Typically, DBMSs use their own semaphores2 to guarantee mutually exclu- sive access to shared resources. Since these semaphores are implemented in 2Semaphores are data structures used for synchronized and exclusive access to shared resources for preventing race conditions in a parallel computing system.\n",
      "\n",
      "23.5 Query Processing and Optimization in Distributed Databases  859 user space at the level of the DBMS application software, the OS has no knowledge about them. Hence if the OS deactivates a DBMS process hold-ing a lock, other DBMS processes wanting this locked resource get blocked. Such a situation can cause serious performance degradation. OS-level knowledge of semaphores can help eliminate such situations. ■Specialized hardware support for locking can be exploited to reduce associ- ated costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "This can be of great importance, since locking is one of the most common DBMS operations. ■Providing a set of common transaction support operations though the kernel allows application developers to focus on adding new features to their prod-ucts as opposed to reimplementing the common functionality for each appli-cation.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if different DDBMSs are to coexist on the same machine and they chose the two-phase commit protocol, then it is more beneficial to have this protocol implemented as part of the kernel so that the DDBMS developers can focus more on adding new features to their products.\n",
      "\n",
      "23.5  Query Processing and Optimization in   Distributed Databases Now we give an overview of how a DDBMS processes and optimizes a query. First we discuss the steps involved in query processing and then elaborate on the commu-nication costs of processing a distributed query. Then we discuss a special operation, called a semijoin,  which is used to optimize some types of queries in a DDBMS. A detailed discussion about optimization algorithms is beyond the scope of this text. We attempt to illustrate optimization principles using suitable examples. 3\n",
      "\n",
      "23.5.1 Distributed Query Processing A distributed database query is processed in stages as follows: 1. Query Mapping. The input query on distributed data is specified formally using a query language. It is then translated into an algebraic query on global relations. This translation is done by referring to the global conceptual schema and does not take into account the actual distribution and replica-tion of data. Hence, this translation is largely identical to the one performed in a centralized DBMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is first normalized, analyzed for semantic errors, simplified, and finally restructured into an algebraic query. 2. Localization. In a distributed database, fragmentation results in relations being stored in separate sites, with some fragments possibly being repli- cated. This stage maps the distributed query on the global schema to sepa- rate queries on individual fragments using data distribution and replication information.\n",
      "\n",
      "3For a detailed discussion of optimization algorithms, see Ozsu and Valduriez (1999).860 Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts 3. Global Query Optimization. Optimization consists of selecting a strategy from a list of candidates that is closest to optimal. A list of candidate queries can be obtained by permuting the ordering of operations within a fragment query generated by the previous stage. Time is the preferred unit for mea-suring cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "The total cost is a weighted combination of costs such as CPU cost, I/O costs, and communication costs. Since DDBs are connected by a network, often the communication costs over the network are the most sig-nificant. This is especially true when the sites are connected through a wide area network (WAN). 4. Local Query Optimization. This stage is common to all sites in the DDB. The techniques are similar to those used in centralized systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first three stages discussed above are performed at a central control site, whereas the last stage is performed locally.\n",
      "\n",
      "23.5.2 Data Transfer Costs of Distributed Query Processing We discussed the issues involved in processing and optimizing a query in a central-ized DBMS in Chapter 19. In a distributed system, several additional factors further complicate query processing. The first is the cost of transferring data over the net-work. This data includes intermediate files that are transferred to other sites for further processing, as well as the final result files that may have to be transferred to the site where the query result is needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although these costs may not be very high if the sites are connected via a high-performance local area network, they become significant in other types of networks. Hence, DDBMS query optimization algo-rithms consider the goal of reducing the amount of data transfer  as an optimization criterion in choosing a distributed query execution strategy. We illustrate this with two simple sample queries. Suppose that the EMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT  relations in Figure 3.5 are distributed at two sites as shown in Fig- ure 23.4.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will assume in this example that neither relation is fragmented. Accord-ing to Figure 23.4, the size of the EMPLOYEE  relation is 100 * 10,000 = 106 bytes, and the size of the DEPARTMENT  relation is 35 * 100 = 3,500 bytes. Consider the query Q: For each employee, retrieve the employee name and the name of the department for which the employee works.\n",
      "\n",
      "This can be stated as follows in the relational algebra: Q: πFname,Lname,Dname (EMPLOYEE   Dno=Dnumber  DEPARTMENT ) The result of this query will include 10,000 records, assuming that every employee is related to a department. Suppose that each record in the query result is 40 bytes long. The query is submitted at a distinct site 3, which is called the result site because the query result is needed there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither the EMPLOYEE  nor the DEPARTMENT  relations reside at site 3. There are three simple strategies for execut- ing this distributed query: 1. Transfer both the EMPLOYEE  and the DEPARTMENT  relations to the result site, and perform the join at site 3. In this case, a total of 1,000,000 + 3,500 = 1,003,500 bytes must be transferred.\n",
      "\n",
      "23.5 Query Processing and Optimization in Distributed Databases  861 2. Transfer the EMPLOYEE  relation to site 2, execute the join at site 2, and send the result to site 3. The size of the query result is 40 * 10,000 = 400,000 bytes, so 400,000 + 1,000,000 = 1,400,000 bytes must be transferred. 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transfer the DEPARTMENT  relation to site 1, execute the join at site 1, and send the result to site 3. In this case, 400,000 + 3,500 = 403,500 bytes must be transferred. If minimizing the amount of data transfer is our optimization criterion, we should choose strategy 3. Now consider another query Q′: For each department, retrieve the department name and the name of the department manager.\n",
      "\n",
      "This can be stated as follows in the relational algebra: Q′: πFname,Lname,Dname (DEPARTMENT   Mgr_ssn =Ssn EMPLOYEE ) Again, suppose that the query is submitted at site 3. The same three strategies for executing query Q apply to Q′, except that the result of Q′ includes only 100 records, assuming that each department has a manager: 1.\n",

Transfer the EMPLOYEE  relation to site 2, execute the query, and present the result to the user at site 2. Here, the same number of bytes—1,000,000—must be transferred for both Q and Q′. 2. Transfer the DEPARTMENT  relation to site 1, execute the query at site 1, and send the result back to site 2.\n",

A more complex strategy, which sometimes works better than these simple strate- gies, uses an operation called semijoin . We introduce this operation and discuss distributed execution using semijoins next.\n",
      "\n",
      "23.5.3 Distributed Query Processing Using Semijoin The idea behind distributed query processing using the semijoin operation  is to reduce the number of tuples in a relation before transferring it to another site.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intuitively, the idea is to send the joining column  of one relation R to the site where the other relation S is located; this column is then joined with S. Following that, the join attributes, along with the attributes required in the result, are projected out and shipped back to the original site and joined with R. Hence, only the join- ing column of R is transferred in one direction, and a subset of S with no extrane- ous tuples or attributes is transferred in the other direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "If only a small fraction of the tuples in S participate in the join, this can be an efficient solution to mini- mizing data transfer. To illustrate this, consider the following strategy for executing Q or Q′: 1. Project the join attributes of DEPARTMENT  at site 2, and transfer them to site 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Q, we transfer F = πDnumber (DEPARTMENT ), whose size is 4 * 100 = 400 bytes, whereas for Q′, we transfer F′ = πMgr_ssn (DEPARTMENT ), whose size is 9 * 100 = 900 bytes. 2. Join the transferred file with the EMPLOYEE  relation at site 1, and transfer the required attributes from the resulting file to site 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Q, we transfer R = πDno, Fname, Lname (F  Dnumber=Dno  EMPLOYEE ), whose size is 34 * 10,000 = 340,000 bytes, whereas for Q′, we transfer R′ = πMgr_ssn, Fname, Lname (F′  Mgr_ssn=Ssn  EMPLOYEE ), whose size is 39 * 100 = 3,900 bytes. 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Execute the query by joining the transferred file R or R′ with DEPARTMENT , and present the result to the user at site 2. Using this strategy, we transfer 340,400 bytes for Q and 4,800 bytes for Q′. We lim- ited the EMPLOYEE  attributes and tuples transmitted to site 2 in step 2 to only those that will actually be joined  with a DEPARTMENT  tuple in step 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "For query Q, this turned out to include all EMPLOYEE  tuples, so little improvement was achieved. However, for Q′ only 100 out of the 10,000 EMPLOYEE  tuples were needed. 23.5 Query Processing and Optimization in Distributed Databases  863 The semijoin operation was devised to formalize this strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "A semijoin operation R A=B S, where A and B are domain-compatible attributes of R and S, respectively, produces the same result as the relational algebra expression πR(R A=B S). In a dis- tributed environment where R and S reside at different sites, the semijoin is typically implemented by first transferring F = πB(S) to the site where R resides and then join- ing F with R, thus leading to the strategy discussed here.\n",

      "\n",
      "23.5.4 Query and Update Decomposition In a DDBMS with no distribution transparency,  the user phrases a query directly in terms of specific fragments. For example, consider another query Q: Retrieve the names and hours per week for each employee who works on some project controlled by department 5 , which is specified on the distributed database where the relations at sites 2 and 3 are shown in Figure 23.2, and those at site 1 are shown in Fig-ure 5.6, as in our earlier example.\n",
      "\n",
      "A user who submits such a query must specify whether it references the PROJS_5  and WORKS_ON_5  relations at site 2 (Fig- ure 23.2) or the PROJECT  and WORKS_ON  relations at site 1 (Figure 5.6). The user must also maintain consistency of replicated data items when updating a DDBMS with no replication transparency.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, a DDBMS that supports full distribution, fragmentation,  and replication transparency  allows the user to specify a query or update request on the schema in Figure 5.5 just as though the DBMS were centralized. For updates, the DDBMS is responsible for maintaining consistency among replicated items by using one of the distributed concurrency control algorithms discussed in  Section 23.3. For queries, a query decomposition  module must break up or decompose  a query into subqueries  that can be executed at the individual sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, a strategy for combining the results of the subqueries to form the query result must be generated. Whenever the DDBMS determines that an item referenced in the query is replicated, it must choose or materialize  a particular replica during query execution. To determine which replicas include the data items referenced in a query, the DDBMS refers to the fragmentation, replication, and distribution information stored in the DDBMS catalog. For vertical fragmentation, the attribute list for each fragment is kept in the catalog.\n",
      "\n",
      "For horizontal fragmentation, a condition, sometimes called a guard , is kept for each fragment. This is basically a selection condition that specifies which tuples exist in the fragment; it is called a guard because only tuples that satisfy this condition  are permitted to be stored in the fragment. For mixed fragments, both the attribute list and the guard condition are kept in the catalog. In our earlier example, the guard conditions for fragments at site 1 (Figure 5.6) are TRUE (all tuples), and the attribute lists are * (all attributes).\n",
      "\n",
      "For the fragments 864 Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts shown in Figure 23.2, we have the guard conditions and attribute lists shown in Figure 23.5. When the DDBMS decomposes an update request, it can determine which fragments must be updated by examining their guard conditions.\n",

Subquery T2 can then be executed at site 1, and the result can be sent back to site 2, where the final query result is calculated and displayed to the user.\n",

      "23.6 Types of Distributed Database Systems   The term distributed database management system  can describe various systems that differ from one another in many respects. The main thing that all such systems have in common is the fact that data and software are distributed over multiple sites connected by some form of communication network. In this section, we discuss a number of types of DDBMSs and the criteria and factors that make some of these systems different. The first factor we consider is the degree of homogeneity  of the DDBMS software.\n",
      "\n",
      "If all servers (or individual local DBMSs) use identical software and all users (clients) use identical software, the DDBMS is called homogeneous ; otherwise, it is called hetero- geneous . Another factor related to the degree of homogeneity is the degree of local autonomy . If there is no provision for the local site to function as a standalone DBMS, then the system has no local autonomy . On the other hand, if direct access  by local transactions to a server is permitted, the system has some degree of local autonomy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 23.6 shows classification of DDBMS alternatives along orthogonal axes of distribution, autonomy, and heterogeneity. For a centralized database, there is 866 Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts complete autonomy but a total lack of distribution and heterogeneity (point A in the figure). We see that the degree of local autonomy provides further ground for classification into federated and multidatabase systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one extreme of the autonomy spectrum, we have a DDBMS that looks like  a centralized DBMS to the user, with zero autonomy (point B). A single conceptual schema exists, and all access to the system is obtained through a site that is part of the DDBMS—which means that no local autonomy exists. Along the autonomy axis we encounter two types of DDBMSs called federated database system  (point C) and multidatabase system  (point D) .\n",
      "\n",
      "In such systems, each server is an independent and autonomous centralized DBMS that has its own local users, local transactions, and DBA, and hence has a very high degree of local autonomy. The term federated database system (FDBS)  is used when there is some global view or schema of the federation of databases that is shared by the applications (point C). On the other hand, a  multidatabase system  has full local autonomy in that it does not have a global schema but interactively constructs one as needed by the application (point D).\n",
      "\n",
      "Both systems are hybrids between distributed and centralized systems, and the distinction we made between them is not strictly followed. We will refer to them as FDBSs in a generic sense. Point D in the diagram may also stand for a system with full local autonomy and full heterogeneity—this could be a peer-to-peer database system.\n",
      "\n",

We briefly discuss the issues affecting the design of FDBSs next.\n",
      "\n",
      "23.6.1 Federated Database Management Systems Issues The type of heterogeneity present in FDBSs may arise from several sources. We discuss these sources first and then point out how the different types of autonomies contribute to a semantic heterogeneity that must be resolved in a heterogeneous FDBS. ■Differences in data models. Databases in an organization come from a vari- ety of data models, including the so-called legacy models (hierarchical and network), the relational data model, the object data model, and even files.\n",
      "\n",
      "The modeling capabilities of the models vary. Hence, to deal with them uni-formly via a single global schema or to process them in a single language is challenging. Even if two databases are both from the RDBMS environment, the same information may be represented as an attribute name, as a relation name, or as a value in different databases. This calls for an intelligent query-processing mechanism that can relate information based on metadata. ■Differences in constraints. Constraint facilities for specification and imple- mentation vary from system to system.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are comparable features that must be reconciled in the construction of a global schema. For example, the relationships from ER models are represented as referential integrity con- straints in the relational model. Triggers may have to be used to implement certain constraints in the relational model. The global schema must also deal with potential conflicts among constraints. ■Differences in query languages. Even with the same data model, the lan- guages and their versions vary.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, SQL has multiple versions like SQL-89, SQL-92, SQL-99, and SQL:2008, and each system has its own set of data types, comparison operators, string manipulation features, and so on. Semantic Heterogeneity. Semantic heterogeneity occurs when there are differ- ences in the meaning, interpretation, and intended use of the same or related data. Semantic heterogeneity among component database systems (DBSs) creates the biggest hurdle in designing global schemas of heterogeneous databases.\n",
      "\n",
      "The design autonomy  of component DBSs refers to their freedom of choosing the following design parameters; the design parameters in turn affect the eventual complexity of the FDBS: ■The universe of discourse from which the data is drawn. For example, for two customer accounts, databases in the federation may be from the United States and Japan and have entirely different sets of attributes about customer accounts required by the accounting practices. Currency rate fluctuations 868 Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts would also present a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, relations in these two databases that have identical names— CUSTOMER  or ACCOUNT —may have some common and some entirely distinct information. ■Representation and naming. The representation and naming of data ele- ments and the structure of the data model may be prespecified for each local database. ■The understanding, meaning, and subjective interpretation of data. This is a chief contributor to semantic heterogeneity. ■Transaction and policy constraints. These deal with serializability criteria, compensating transactions, and other transaction policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Derivation of summaries. Aggregation, summarization, and other data- processing features and operations supported by the system. The above problems related to semantic heterogeneity are being faced by all major multinational and governmental organizations in all application areas. In today’s commercial environment, most enterprises are resorting to heterogeneous FDBSs, having heavily invested in the development of individual database systems using diverse data models on different platforms over the last 20 to 30 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enterprises are using various forms of software—typically called the middleware ; or Web- based packages called application servers  (for example, WebLogic or WebSphere); and even generic systems, called enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems  (for example, SAP, J. D. Edwards ERP)—to manage the transport of queries and trans-actions from the global application to individual databases (with possible additional processing for business rules) and the data from the heterogeneous database servers to the global application. Detailed discussion of these types of software systems is outside the scope of this text.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as providing the ultimate transparency is the goal of any distributed database architecture, local component databases strive to preserve autonomy. Communication autonomy  of a component DBS refers to its ability to decide whether to communicate with another component DBS. Execution autonomy refers to the ability of a component DBS to execute local operations without inter-ference from external operations by other component DBSs and its ability to decide the order in which to execute them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The association autonomy  of a component DBS implies that it has the ability to decide whether and how much to share its functionality (operations it supports) and resources (data it manages) with other component DBSs. The major challenge of designing FDBSs is to let component DBSs interoperate while still providing the above types of autonomies to them.\n",

      "23.7.1 Parallel versus Distributed Architectures There are two main types of multiprocessor system architectures that are com-monplace: ■Shared memory (tightly coupled) architecture. Multiple processors share secondary (disk) storage and also share primary memory. ■Shared disk (loosely coupled) architecture. Multiple processors share sec- ondary (disk) storage but each has their own primary memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "These architectures enable processors to communicate without the overhead of exchanging messages over a network.4 Database management systems developed using the above types of architectures are termed parallel database management systems  rather than DDBMSs, since they utilize parallel processor technology. Another type of multiprocessor architecture is called shared-nothing architecture . In this architecture, every processor has its own primary and secondary (disk) memory, no common memory exists, and the processors communicate over a high-speed interconnection network (bus or switch).\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the shared-nothing architecture resembles a distributed database computing environment, major dif-ferences exist in the mode of operation. In shared-nothing multiprocessor systems, there is symmetry and homogeneity of nodes; this is not true of the distributed database environment, where heterogeneity of hardware and operating system at each node is very common. Shared-nothing architecture is also considered as an environment for parallel databases.\n",

In Figure 23.8, which describes the generic schema architecture of a DDB, the enterprise is presented with a consistent, unified view showing the logical structure of underlying data across all nodes.

The latter is particularly important in queries involving joins. Having computed the cost for each candidate, the optimizer selects the candidate with the minimum cost for execution. Each local DBMS would have its local query optimizer, transaction manager, and execution engines as well as the local system catalog, which houses the local schemas.\n",

In this architecture, the local schema  is the User conceptual schema (full database definition) of a component database, and the component schema  is derived by translating the local schema into a canonical data model or common data model (CDM) for the FDBS.\n",

      "Schema translation from the local schema to the component schema is accompanied by generating mappings to transform commands on a component schema into commands on the correspond- ing local schema.

Instead, distributed database applications are being developed in the context of the client/server architectures. We introduced the two-tier client/server architecture in External It is now more common to use a three-tier architecture rather than a two-tier architecture, particularly in Web applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "This architecture is illus-trated in Figure 23.10. In the three-tier client/server architecture, the following three layers exist: 1. Presentation layer (client). This provides the user interface and interacts with the user. The programs at this layer present Web interfaces or forms to the client in order to interface with the application.\n",

This layer handles user input, output, and naviga-tion by accepting user commands and displaying the needed information, usually in the form of static or dynamic Web pages. The latter are employed when the interaction involves database access. When a Web interface is used, this layer typically communicates with the application layer via the HTTP protocol. 2.\n",

Usually SQL is used to access the database if it is relational or object-relational, and stored database procedures may also be invoked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Query results (and queries) may be formatted into XML (see Chapter 13) when transmitted between the application server and the database server. Exactly how to divide the DBMS functionality among the client, application server, and database server may vary. The common approach is to include the functional-ity of a centralized DBMS at the database server level. A number of relational DBMS products have taken this approach, in which an SQL server  is provided. The appli- cation server must then formulate the appropriate SQL queries and connect to the database server when needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The client provides the processing for user interface interactions. Since SQL is a relational standard, various SQL servers, possibly pro-vided by different vendors, can accept SQL commands through standards such as ODBC, JDBC, and SQL/CLI (see Chapter 10). In this architecture, the application server may also refer to a data dictionary that includes information on the distribution of data among the various SQL servers, as well as modules for decomposing a global query into a number of local queries that can be executed at the various sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interaction between an application server and database server might proceed as follows during the pro-cessing of an SQL query: 1. The application server formulates a user query based on input from the cli-ent layer and decomposes it into a number of independent site queries. Each site query is sent to the appropriate database server site. 2. Each database server processes the local query and sends the results to the application server site.\n",

      "Increasingly, XML is being touted as the standard for data exchange (see Chapter 13), so the database server may format the query result into XML before sending it to the application server. 3. The application server combines the results of the subqueries to produce the result of the originally required query, formats it into HTML or some other form accepted by the client, and sends it to the client site for display. The application server is responsible for generating a distributed execution plan for a multisite query or transaction and for supervising distributed execution by send- ing commands to servers.\n",

      "These commands include local queries and transactions to be executed, as well as commands to transmit data to other clients or servers. Another function controlled by the application server (or coordinator) is that of ensuring consistency of replicated copies of a data item by employing distributed (or global) concurrency control techniques. The application server must also ensure the atomicity of global transactions by performing global recovery when certain sites fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the DDBMS has the capability to hide  the details of data distribution from the application server, then it enables the application server to execute global queries and transactions as though the database were centralized, without having to specify  23.8 Distributed Catalog Management  875 the sites at which the data referenced in the query or transaction resides. This property is called distribution transparency . Some DDBMSs do not provide distri- bution transparency, instead requiring that applications are aware of the details of data distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "23.8 Distributed Catalog Management Efficient catalog management in distributed databases is critical to ensure satisfac- tory performance related to site autonomy, view management, and data distribu-tion and replication. Catalogs are databases themselves containing metadata about the distributed database system. Three popular management schemes for distributed catalogs are centralized  cata- logs, fully replicated  catalogs, and partitioned  catalogs. The choice of the scheme depends on the database itself as well as the access patterns of the applications to the underlying data. Centralized Catalogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this scheme, the entire catalog is stored in one single site. Due to its central nature, it is easy to implement. On the other hand, the advantages of reliability, availability, autonomy, and distribution of processing load are adversely impacted. For read operations from noncentral sites, the requested catalog data is locked at the central site and is then sent to the requesting site. On completion of the read operation, an acknowledgment is sent to the central site, which in turn unlocks this data. All update operations must be processed through the central site.\n",
      "\n",
      "This can quickly become a perfor-mance bottleneck for write-intensive applications. Fully Replicated Catalogs. In this scheme, identical copies of the complete catalog are present at each site. This scheme facilitates faster reads by allowing them to be answered locally. However, all updates must be broadcast to all sites. Updates are treated as transactions, and a centralized two-phase commit scheme is employed to ensure catalog consistency. As with the centralized scheme, write-intensive applications may cause increased network traffic due to the broadcast associated with the writes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Partially Replicated Catalogs. The centralized and fully replicated schemes restrict site autonomy since they must ensure a consistent global view of the catalog. Under the partially replicated scheme, each site maintains complete catalog information on data stored locally at that site. Each site is also permit-ted to cache entries retrieved from remote sites. However, there are no guaran-tees that these cached copies will be the most recent and updated. The system tracks catalog entries for sites where the object was created and for sites that contain copies of this object.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any changes to copies are propagated immedi-ately to the original (birth) site. Retrieving updated copies to replace stale data may be delayed until an access to this data occurs. In general, fragments of rela- tions across sites should be uniquely accessible. Also, to ensure data distribu-tion transparency, users should be allowed to create synonyms for remote objects and use these synonyms for subsequent referrals.876 Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts\n",
      "\n",
      "23.9 Summary   In this chapter, we provided an introduction to distributed databases. This is a very broad topic, and we discussed only some of the basic techniques used with distrib-uted databases. First in Section 23.1 we discussed the reasons for distribution and DDB concepts in Section 23.1.1. Then we defined the concept of distribution trans-parency and the related concepts of fragmentation transparency and replication transparency in Section 23.1.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "We discussed the concepts of distributed availability and reliability in Section 23.1.3, and gave an overview of scalability and partition tolerance issues in Section 23.1.4. We discussed autonomy of nodes in a distributed system in Section 23.1.5 and the potential advantages of distributed databases over centralized system in Section 23.1.6. In Section 23.2, we discussed the design issues related to data fragmentation, replication, and distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "We distinguished between horizontal fragmenta-tion (sharding) and vertical fragmentation of relations in Section 23.2.1. We then discussed in Section 23.2.2 the use of data replication to improve system reliability and availability. In Section 23.3, we briefly discussed the concur-rency control and recovery techniques used in DDBMSs, and then reviewed some of the additional problems that must be dealt with in a distributed envi-ronment that do not appear in a centralized environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in Section 23.4 we discussed transaction management, including different commit protocols (2-phase commit, 3-phase commit) and operating system support for transac- tion management. We then illustrated some of the techniques used in distributed query processing in Section 23.5, and discussed the cost of communication among sites, which is con- sidered a major factor in distributed query optimization. We compared the differ- ent techniques for executing joins, and we then presented the semijoin technique for joining relations that reside on different sites in Section 23.5.3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following that, in Section 23.6, we categorized DDBMSs by using criteria such as the degree of homogeneity of software modules and the degree of local autonomy. In Section 23.7 we distinguished between parallel and distributed system architec-tures and then introduced the generic architecture of distributed databases from both a component as well as a schematic architectural perspective. In Section 23.7.3 we discussed in some detail issues of federated database management, and we focused on the needs of supporting various types of autonomies and dealing with semantic heterogeneity.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also reviewed the client/server architecture concepts and related them to distributed databases in Section 23.7.4. We reviewed catalog management in distributed databases and summarized their relative advantages and disadvantages in Section 23.8. Chapters 24 and 25 will describe recent advances in distributed databases and dis- tributed computing related to big data. Chapter 24 describes the so-called NOSQL systems, which are highly scalable, distributed database systems that handle large volumes of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 25 discusses cloud computing and distributed computing technologies that are needed to process big data.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.1.1 Emergence of NOSQL Systems Many companies and organizations are faced with applications that store vast amounts of data. Consider a free e-mail application, such as Google Mail or Yahoo Mail or other similar service—this application can have millions of users, and each user can have thousands of e-mail messages. There is a need for a storage system that can manage all these e-mails; a structured relational SQL system may not be appropriate because (1) SQL systems offer too many services (powerful query lan-guage, concurrency control, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "), which this application may not need; and (2) a structured data model such the traditional relational model may be too restrictive. Although newer relational systems do have more complex object-relational model-ing options (see Chapter 12), they still require schemas, which are not required by many of the NOSQL systems. As another example, consider an application such as Facebook, with millions of users who submit posts, many with images and videos; then these posts must be displayed on pages of other users using the social media relationships among the users.\n",
      "\n",
      "User profiles, user relationships, and posts must all be stored in a huge collec-tion of data stores, and the appropriate posts must be made available to the sets of users that have signed up to see these posts. Some of the data for this type of appli-cation is not suitable for a traditional relational system and typically needs multiple types of databases and data storage systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the organizations that were faced with these data management and storage applications decided to develop their own systems: ■Google developed a proprietary NOSQL system known as BigTable , which is used in many of Google’s applications that require vast amounts of data stor-age, such as Gmail, Google Maps, and Web site indexing. Apache Hbase is an open source NOSQL system based on similar concepts. Google’s innovation led to the category of NOSQL systems known as column-based  or wide column  stores; they are also sometimes referred to as column family  stores.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Amazon developed a NOSQL system called DynamoDB  that is available through Amazon’s cloud services. This innovation led to the category known as key-value  data stores or sometimes key-tuple  or key-object  data stores. ■Facebook developed a NOSQL system called Cassandra , which is now open source and known as Apache Cassandra. This NOSQL system uses concepts from both key-value stores and column-based systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Other software companies started developing their own solutions and making them available to users who need these capabilities—for example, MongoDB and CouchDB , which are classified as document-based  NOSQL systems or document stores . ■Another category of NOSQL systems is the graph-based  NOSQL systems, or graph databases ; these include Neo4J  and GraphBase , among others. 24.1 Introduction to NOSQL Systems  885 ■Some NOSQL systems, such as OrientDB , combine concepts from many of the categories discussed above.\n",
      "\n",
      "■In addition to the newer types of NOSQL systems listed above, it is also pos- sible to classify database systems based on the object model (see Chapter 12) or on the native XML model (see Chapter 13) as NOSQL systems, although they may not have the high-performance and replication characteristics of the other types of NOSQL systems. These are just a few examples of NOSQL systems that have been developed. There are many systems, and listing all of them is beyond the scope of our presentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.1.2 Characteristics of NOSQL Systems We now discuss the characteristics of many NOSQL systems, and how these sys-tems differ from traditional SQL systems. We divide the characteristics into two categories—those related to distributed databases and distributed systems, and those related to data models and query languages. NOSQL characteristics related to distributed databases and distributed systems. NOSQL systems emphasize high availability, so replicating the data is inherent in many of these systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scalability is another important characteristic, because many of the applications that use NOSQL systems tend to have data that keeps growing in volume. High performance is another required characteristic, whereas serializable consistency may not be as important for some of the NOSQL applications. We discuss some of these characteristics next. 1. Scalability:  As we discussed in Section 23.1.4, there are two kinds of scal- ability in distributed systems: horizontal and vertical.\n",
      "\n",
      "In NOSQL systems, horizontal scalability  is generally used, where the distributed system is expanded by adding more nodes for data storage and processing as the vol-ume of data grows. Vertical scalability, on the other hand, refers to expand-ing the storage and computing power of existing nodes. In NOSQL systems, horizontal scalability is employed while the system is operational, so tech-niques for distributing the existing data among new nodes without inter- rupting system operation are necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will discuss some of these techniques in Sections 24.3 through  24.6 when we discuss specific systems. 2. Availability, Replication and Eventual Consistency:  Many applications that use NOSQL systems require continuous system availability. To accom-plish this, data is replicated over two or more nodes in a transparent man-ner, so that if one node fails, the data is still available on other nodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Replication improves data availability and can also improve read perfor-mance, because read requests can often be serviced from any of the repli-cated data nodes. However, write performance becomes more cumbersome because an update must be applied to every copy of the replicated data items; this can slow down write performance if serializable consistency is required (see Section 23.3).\n",
      "\n",
      "Many NOSQL applications do not require serializable 886 Chapter 24 NOSQL Databases and Big Data Storage Systems consistency, so more relaxed forms of consistency known as eventual consistency  are used. We discuss this in more detail in Section 24.2. 3. Replication Models:  Two major replication models are used in NOSQL sys- tems: master-slave and master-master replication.\n",
      "\n",
      "Master-slave replication requires one copy to be the master copy; all write operations must be applied to the master copy and then propagated to the slave copies, usually using eventual consistency (the slave copies will eventually  be the same as the mas- ter copy). For read, the master-slave paradigm can be configured in various ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "One configuration requires all reads to also be at the master copy, so this would be similar to the primary site or primary copy methods of distrib-uted concurrency control (see Section 23.3.1), with similar advantages and disadvantages. Another configuration would allow reads at the slave copies but would not guarantee that the values are the latest writes, since writes to the slave nodes can be done after they are applied to the master copy. The master-master replication  allows reads and writes at any of the replicas but may not guarantee that reads at nodes that store different copies see the same values.\n",
      "\n",
      "Different users may write the same data item concurrently at different nodes of the system, so the values of the item will be temporarily inconsistent. A reconciliation method to resolve conflicting write operations of the same data item at different nodes must be implemented as part of the master-master replication scheme. 4. Sharding of Files:  In many NOSQL applications, files (or collections of data objects) can have many millions of records (or documents or objects), and these records can be accessed concurrently by thousands of users.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it is not practical to store the whole file in one node. Sharding  (also known as horizontal partitioning  ; see Section 23.2) of the file records is often employed in NOSQL systems. This serves to distribute the load of accessing the file records to multiple nodes. The combination of sharding the file records and replicating the shards works in tandem to improve load  balancing as well as data availability. We will discuss some of the sharding techniques in Sections 24.3 through  24.6 when we discuss specific systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. High-Performance Data Access:  In many NOSQL applications, it is neces- sary to find individual records or objects (data items) from among the mil-lions of data records or objects in a file. To achieve this, most systems use one of two techniques: hashing or range partitioning on object keys. The majority of accesses to an object will be by providing the key value rather than by using complex query conditions. The object key is similar to the concept of object id (see Section 12.1).\n",
      "\n",
      "In hashing , a hash function h(K)  is applied to the key K, and the location of the object with key K is determined by the value of h(K) . In range partitioning , the location is determined via a range of key values; for example, location i would hold the objects whose key values K are in the range Ki min ≤ K ≤ Ki max. In applications that require range queries, where multiple objects within a range of key values are retrieved, range partitioned is preferred.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other indexes can also be used to locate objects based on attribute conditions different from the key K. We  24.1 Introduction to NOSQL Systems  887 will discuss some of the hashing, partitioning, and indexing techniques in Sections 24.3 through  24.6 when we discuss specific systems. NOSQL characteristics related to data models and query languages. NOSQL systems emphasize performance and flexibility over modeling power and complex querying. We discuss some of these characteristics next. 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not Requiring a Schema:  The flexibility of not requiring a schema is achieved in many NOSQL systems by allowing semi-structured, self-describing data (see Section 13.1). The users can specify a partial schema in some systems to improve storage efficiency, but it is not required to have a schema  in most of the NOSQL systems. As there may not be a schema to specify constraints, any constraints on the data would have to be pro-grammed in the application programs that access the data items.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are various languages for describing semistructured data, such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (Extensible Markup Language; see Chapter 13). JSON is used in several NOSQL systems, but other methods for describing semi-structured data can also be used. We will discuss JSON in Section 24.3 when we present document-based NOSQL systems. 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Less Powerful Query Languages:  Many applications that use NOSQL sys- tems may not require a powerful query language such as SQL, because search (read) queries in these systems often locate single objects in a single file based on their object keys. NOSQL systems typically provide a set of functions and operations as a programming API (application programming interface), so reading and writing the data objects is accomplished by calling the appropriate operations by the programmer. In many cases, the opera- tions are called CRUD operations , for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other cases, they are known as SCRUD  because of an added Search (or Find) operation. Some NOSQL systems also provide a high-level query language, but it may not have the full power of SQL; only a subset of SQL querying capabilities would be provided. In particular, many NOSQL systems do not provide join operations as part of the query language itself; the joins need to be implemented in the application programs. 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Versioning:  Some NOSQL systems provide storage of multiple versions of the data items, with the timestamps of when the data version was created. We will discuss this aspect in Section 24.5 when we present column-based NOSQL systems. In the next section, we give an overview of the various categories of NOSQL systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.1.3 Categories of NOSQL Systems NOSQL systems have been characterized into four major categories, with some additional categories that encompass other types of systems. The most common categorization lists the following four major categories:888 Chapter 24 NOSQL Databases and Big Data Storage Systems 1. Document-based NOSQL systems:  These systems store data in the form of documents using well-known formats, such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). Documents are accessible via their document id, but can also be accessed rapidly using other indexes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. NOSQL key-value stores:  These systems have a simple data model based on fast access by the key to the value associated with the key; the value can be a record or an object or a document or even have a more complex data structure. 3. Column-based or wide column NOSQL systems:  These systems partition a table by column into column families (a form of vertical partitioning; see Section 23.2), where each column family is stored in its own files. They also allow versioning of data values. 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Graph-based NOSQL systems:  Data is represented as graphs, and related nodes can be found by traversing the edges using path expressions. Additional categories can be added as follows to include some systems that are not easily categorized into the above four categories, as well as some other types of sys- tems that have been available even before the term NOSQL became widely used. 5. Hybrid NOSQL systems:  These systems have characteristics from two or more of the above four categories. 6. Object databases:  These systems were discussed in Chapter 12.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. XML databases:  We discussed XML in Chapter 13. Even keyword-based search engines store large amounts of data with fast search access, so the stored data can be considered as large NOSQL big data stores. The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. In each of Sections 24.3 through\n",
      "\n",
      "24.6, we will discuss one of the four main categories of NOSQL systems, and elabo-rate further on which characteristics each category focuses on. Before that, in Sec-tion 24.2, we discuss in more detail the concept of eventual consistency, and we discuss the associated CAP theorem.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.2 The CAP Theorem   When we discussed concurrency control in distributed databases in Section 23.3, we assumed that the distributed database system (DDBS) is required to enforce the ACID properties (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) of transactions that are running concurrently (see Section 20.3). In a system with data replication, con- currency control becomes more complex because there can be multiple copies of each data item.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if an update is applied to one copy of an item, it must be applied to all other copies in a consistent manner. The possibility exists that one copy of an item X is updated by a transaction T 1 whereas another copy is updated by a transac- tion T2, so two inconsistent copies of the same item exist at two different nodes in the distributed system. If two other transactions T3 and T4 want to read X, each may read a different copy of item X.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.2 The CAP Theorem  889 We saw in Section 23.3 that there are distributed concurrency control methods that do not allow this inconsistency among copies of the same data item, thus enforcing serializability and hence the isolation property in the presence of replication. How-ever, these techniques often come with high overhead, which would defeat the pur-pose of creating multiple copies to improve performance and availability in distributed database systems such as NOSQL.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the field of distributed systems, there are various levels of consistency among replicated data items, from weak con-sistency to strong consistency. Enforcing serializability is considered the strongest form of consistency, but it has high overhead so it can reduce performance of read and write operations and hence adversely affect system performance. The CAP theorem, which was originally introduced as the CAP principle, can be used to explain some of the competing requirements in a distributed system with replication.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three letters in CAP refer to three desirable properties of distributed systems with replicated data: consistency  (among replicated copies), availability  (of the system for read and write operations) and partition tolerance  (in the face of the nodes in the system being partitioned by a network fault). Availability  means that each read or write request for a data item will either be processed successfully or will receive a message that the operation cannot be completed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Partition tolerance  means that the system can continue operating if the network connecting the nodes has a fault that results in two or more partitions, where the nodes in each partition can only communicate among each other. Consistency  means that the nodes will have the same copies of a replicated data item visible for various transactions. It is important to note here that the use of the word consistency  in CAP and its use in ACID do not refer to the same identical concept .\n",
      "\n",
      "In CAP, the term consistency refers to the consistency of the values in different copies of the same data item in a replicated distributed system. In ACID, it refers to the fact that a transaction will not violate the integrity constraints specified on the database schema. However, if we consider that the consistency of replicated copies is a specified constraint , then the two uses of the term consistency  would be related.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CAP theorem  states that it is not possible to guarantee all three  of the desirable properties—consistency, availability, and partition tolerance—at the same time in a distributed system with data replication. If this is the case, then the distributed sys-tem designer would have to choose two properties out of the three to guarantee. It is generally assumed that in many traditional (SQL) applications, guaranteeing consistency through the ACID properties is important.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, in a NOSQL distributed data store, a weaker consistency level is often acceptable, and guaranteeing the other two properties (availability, partition tolerance) is impor-tant. Hence, weaker consistency levels are often used in NOSQL system instead of guaranteeing serializability. In particular, a form of consistency known as eventual consistency  is often adopted in NOSQL systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Sections 24.3 through  24.6, we will discuss some of the consistency models used in specific NOSQL systems. The next four sections of this chapter discuss the characteristics of the four main cat- egories of NOSQL systems. We discuss document-based NOSQL systems in Sec- tion 24.3, and we use MongoDB as a representative system. In Section 24.4, we discuss 890 Chapter 24 NOSQL Databases and Big Data Storage Systems NOSQL systems known as key-value stores.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Section 24.5, we give an overview of column-based NOSQL systems, with a discussion of Hbase as a representative sys-tem. Finally, we introduce graph-based NOSQL systems in Section 24.6.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.3  Document-Based NOSQL Systems and MongoDB Document-based or document-oriented NOSQL systems typically store data as collections  of similar documents . These types of systems are also sometimes known as document stores .\n",
      "\n",
      "The individual documents somewhat resemble complex objects (see Section 12.3) or XML documents (see Chapter 13), but a major difference between document-based systems versus object and object-relational systems and XML is that there is no requirement to specify a schema—rather, the documents are specified as self-describing data  (see Section 13.1). Although the documents in a collection should be similar , they can have different data elements (attributes), and new documents can have new data elements that do not exist in any of the current documents in the collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The system basically extracts the data element names from the self-describing documents in the collection, and the user can request that the system create indexes on some of the data elements. Documents can be speci-fied in various formats, such as XML (see Chapter 13). A popular language to spec-ify documents in NOSQL systems is JSON  (JavaScript Object Notation). There are many document-based NOSQL systems, including MongoDB and CouchDB, among many others. We will give an overview of MongoDB in this sec-tion.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that different systems can use different models, lan-guages, and implementation methods, but giving a complete survey of all document-based NOSQL systems is beyond the scope of our presentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.3.1 MongoDB Data Model MongoDB documents are stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format, which is a varia-tion of JSON with some additional data types and is more efficient for storage than JSON. Individual documents  are stored in a collection . We will use a simple exam- ple based on our COMPANY database that we used throughout this book. The operation createCollection is used to create each collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the fol-lowing command can be used to create a collection called project  to hold PROJECT objects from the COMPANY database (see Figures 5.5 and 5.6): db.createCollection(“project” , { capped : true, size : 1310720, max : 500 } ) The first parameter “project” is the name  of the collection, which is followed by an optional document that specifies collection options .\n",
      "\n",
      "In our example, the collection is capped ; this means it has upper limits on its storage space ( size) and number of documents ( max ). The capping parameters help the system choose the storage options for each collection. There are other collection options, but we will not dis-cuss them here.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.3 Document-Based NOSQL Systems and MongoDB  891 For our example, we will create another document collection called worker  to hold information about the EMPLOYEEs who work on each project; for example: db.createCollection(“worker” , { capped : true, size : 5242880, max : 2000 } ) ) Each document in a collection has a unique ObjectId  field, called _id, which is automatically indexed in the collection unless the user explicitly requests no index for the _id field.\n",
      "\n",
      "The value of ObjectId can be specified by the user , or it can be system-generated  if the user does not specify an _id field for a particular document. System-generated  ObjectIds have a specific format, which combines the timestamp when the object is created (4 bytes, in an internal MongoDB format), the node id (3 bytes), the process id (2 bytes), and a counter (3 bytes) into a 16-byte Id value.\n",
      "\n",
      "User-generated  ObjectsIds can have any value specified by the user as long as it uniquely identifies the document and so these Ids are similar to primary keys in relational systems. A collection does not have a schema. The structure of the data fields in documents is chosen based on how documents will be accessed and used, and the user can choose a normalized design (similar to normalized relational tuples) or a denor-malized design (similar to XML documents or complex objects).\n",
      "\n",
      "Interdocument references can be specified by storing in one document the ObjectId or ObjectIds of other related documents. Figure 24.1(a) shows a simplified MongoDB document showing some of the data from Figure 5.6 from the COMPANY database example that is used throughout the book. In our example, the _id values are user-defined, and the documents whose _id starts with P (for project) will be stored in the “project” collection, whereas those whose _id starts with W (for worker) will be stored in the “worker” collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Figure 24.1(a), the workers information is embedded in the project document ; so there is no need for the “worker” collection. This is known as the denormalized pat- tern, which is similar to creating a complex object (see Chapter 12) or an XML document (see Chapter 13). A list of values that is enclosed in square brackets  [ … ] within a document represents a field whose value is an array .\n",
      "\n",
      "Another option is to use the design in Figure 24.1(b), where worker references  are embedded in the project document, but the worker documents themselves are stored in a separate “worker” collection. A third option in Figure 24.1(c) would use a normalized design, similar to First Normal Form relations (see Sec-tion 14.3.4). The choice of which design option to use depends on how the data will be accessed.\n",
      "\n",

      "24.3.3 MongoDB Distributed Systems Characteristics Most MongoDB updates are atomic if they refer to a single document, but MongoDB also provides a pattern for specifying transactions on multiple documents. Since MongoDB is a distributed system, the two-phase commit  method is used to ensure atomicity and consistency of multidocument transactions. We discussed the atomi-city and consistency properties of transactions in Section 20.3, and the two-phase commit protocol in Section 22.6. Replication in MongoDB.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of replica set  is used in MongoDB to create multiple copies of the same data set on different nodes in the distributed system, and it uses a variation of the master-slave  approach for replication. For example, suppose that we want to replicate a particular document collection C. A replica set will have one primary copy  of the collection C stored in one node N1, and at least one secondary copy  (replica) of C stored at another node N2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional copies can be stored in nodes N3, N4, etc., as needed, but the cost of storage and update (write) increases with the number of replicas. The total number of participants in a replica set must be at least three, so if only one secondary copy is needed, a participant in the  replica set known as an arbiter  must run on the third node N3. The arbiter does not hold a replica of the collection but participates in elections  to choose a new primary if the node storing the current primary copy fails.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the total number of members in a rep-lica set is n (one primary plus i secondaries, for a total of n = i +  1), then n must be an odd number; if it is not, an arbiter  is added to ensure the election process works correctly if the primary fails. We discussed elections in distributed systems in Section 23.3.1. In MongoDB replication, all write operations must be applied to the primary copy and then propagated to the secondaries. For read operations, the user can choose the particular read preference  for their application.\n",
      "\n",
      "The default read preference processes all reads at the primary copy, so all read and write operations are per-formed at the primary node. In this case, secondary copies are mainly to make sure that the system continues operation if the primary fails, and MongoDB can ensure that every read request gets the latest document value.\n",
      "\n",
      "To increase read perfor-mance, it is possible to set the read preference so that read requests can be processed at any replica  (primary or secondary); however, a read at a secondary is not guaran- teed to get the latest version of a document because there can be a delay in propa-gating writes from the primary to the secondaries. Sharding in MongoDB.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a collection holds a very large number of docu- ments or requires a large storage space, storing all the documents in one node can lead to performance problems, particularly if there are many user operations accessing the documents concurrently using various CRUD operations. Sharding of the documents in the collection—also known as horizontal partitioning — divides the documents into disjoint partitions known as shards .\n",
      "\n",
      "This allows the system to add more nodes as needed by a process known as horizontal scaling  of the distributed system (see Section 23.1.4), and to store the shards of the collection on different nodes to achieve load balancing. Each node will process only those operations pertaining to the documents in the shard stored at that node. Also, each  24.4 NOSQL Key-Value Stores  895 shard will contain fewer documents than if the entire collection were stored at one node, thus further improving performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two ways to partition a collection into shards in MongoDB— range partitioning  and hash partitioning . Both require that the user specify a particular document field to be used as the basis for partitioning the documents into shards. The partitioning field —known as the shard key  in MongoDB—must have two characteristics: it must exist in every document  in the collection, and it must have an index . The ObjectId can be used, but any other field possessing these two character- istics can also be used as the basis for sharding.\n",
      "\n",
      "The values of the shard key are divided into chunks  either through range partitioning or hash partitioning, and the documents are partitioned based on the chunks of shard key values.\n",
      "\n",
      "Range partitioning  creates the chunks by specifying a range of key values; for example, if the shard key values ranged from one to ten million, it is possible to create ten ranges—1 to 1,000,000; 1,000,001 to 2,000,000; … ; 9,000,001 to 10,000,000—and each chunk would contain the key values in one range.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hash partitioning  applies a hash function h(K)  to each shard key K, and the partitioning of keys into chunks is based on the hash values (we discussed hashing and its advantages and disadvantages in Section 16.8). In general, if range queries  are commonly applied to a collection (for example, retrieving all documents whose shard key value is between 200 and 400), then range partitioning is preferred because each range query will typically be submit-ted to a single node that contains all the required documents in one shard.\n",
      "\n",
      "If most searches retrieve one document at a time, hash partitioning may be preferable because it randomizes the distribution of shard key values into chunks. When sharding is used, MongoDB queries are submitted to a module called the query router , which keeps track of which nodes contain which shards based on the particu- lar partitioning method used on the shard keys. The query (CRUD operation) will be routed to the nodes that contain the shards that hold the documents that the query is requesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the system cannot determine which shards hold the required docu-ments, the query will be submitted to all the nodes that hold shards of the collection. Sharding and replication are used together; sharding focuses on improving perfor-mance via load balancing and horizontal scalability, whereas replication focuses on ensuring system availability when certain nodes fail in the distributed system. There are many additional details about the distributed system architecture and com- ponents of MongoDB, but a full discussion is outside the scope of our presentation.\n",

The data model used in key-value stores is rela- tively simple, and in many of these systems, there is no query language but rather a 896 Chapter 24 NOSQL Databases and Big Data Storage Systems set of operations that can be used by the application programmers. The key is a unique identifier associated with a data item and is used to locate this data item rapidly.\n",

In some cases, the value is just a string of bytes or an array of bytes , and the application using the key-value store has to interpret the structure of the data value. In other cases, some standard formatted data is allowed; for example, structured data rows (tuples) similar to relational data, or semistructured data using JSON or some other self-describing data format.\n",
      "\n",
      "Differ-ent key-value stores can thus store unstructured, semistructured, or structured data items (see Section 13.1).

      "24.4.1 DynamoDB Overview The DynamoDB system is an Amazon product and is available as part of Amazon’s AWS /SDK  platforms (Amazon Web Services/Software Development Kit). It can be used as part of Amazon’s cloud computing services, for the data storage component. DynamoDB data model. The basic data model in DynamoDB uses the concepts of tables, items, and attributes. A table  in DynamoDB does not have  a schema ; it holds a collection of self-describing items .\n",
      "\n",
      "Each item  will consist of a number of (attribute, value) pairs, and attribute values can be single-valued or multivalued. So basically, a table will hold a collection of items, and each item is a self-describing record (or object). DynamoDB also allows the user to specify the items in JSON for-mat, and the system will convert them to the internal storage format of DynamoDB. When a table is created, it is required to specify a table name  and a primary key ; the primary key will be used to rapidly locate the items in the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the pri-mary key is the key and the item is the value  for the DynamoDB key-value store. The primary key attribute must exist in every item in the table. The primary key can be one of the following two types: ■A single attribute. The DynamoDB system will use this attribute to build a hash index on the items in the table. This is called a hash type primary key . The items are not ordered in storage on the value of the hash attribute. ■A pair of attributes. This is called a hash and range type primary key .\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary key will be a pair of attributes (A, B): attribute A will be used for hash- ing, and because there will be multiple items with the same value of A, the B values will be used for ordering the records with the same A value. A table with this type of key can have additional secondary indexes defined on its attributes. For example, if we want to store multiple versions of some type of items in a table, we could use ItemID as hash and Date or Timestamp (when the version was created) as range in a hash and range type primary key.\n",

Because DynamoDB is proprietary, in the next subsection we will discuss the mechanisms used for replication, sharding, and other distributed system concepts in an open source key-value system called Voldemort. Voldemort is based on many of the techniques proposed for DynamoDB.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.4.2 Voldemort Key-Value Distributed Data Store Voldemort is an open source system available through Apache 2.0 open source licens-ing rules. It is based on Amazon’s DynamoDB. The focus is on high performance and horizontal scalability, as well as on providing replication for high availability and sharding for improving latency (response time) of read and write requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "All three of those features—replication, sharding, and horizontal scalability—are realized through a technique to distribute the key-value pairs among the nodes of a distrib-uted cluster; this distribution is known as consistent hashing . Voldemort has been used by LinkedIn for data storage. Some of the features of Voldemort are as follows: ■Simple basic operations. A collection of (key, value) pairs is kept in a Voldemort store .\n",
      "\n",
      "In our discussion, we will assume the store is called s. The basic interface for data storage and retrieval is very simple and includes three operations: get, put, and delete. The operation s.put(k, v) inserts an item as a key-value pair with key k and value v. The operation s.delete(k) deletes the item whose key is k from the store, and the operation v = s.get(k) retrieves the value v associated with key k. The application can use these basic operations to build its own requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the basic storage level, both keys and values are arrays of bytes (strings). ■High-level formatted data values. The values v in the (k, v) items can be specified in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), and the system will convert between JSON and the internal storage format. Other data object formats can also be specified if the application provides the conversion (also known as serialization ) between the user format and the storage format as a Serializer class .\n",
      "\n",
      "The Serializer class must be provided by the user and will include oper- ations to convert the user format into a string of bytes for storage as a value, and to convert back a string (array of bytes) retrieved via s.get(k)  into the user format. Voldemort has some built-in serializers for formats other than JSON. ■Consistent hashing for distributing (key, value) pairs. A variation of the data distribution algorithm known as consistent hashing  is used in Volde- mort for data distribution among the nodes in the distributed cluster of nodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "A hash function h(k) is applied to the key k of each (k, v) pair, and h(k) determines where the item will be stored. The method assumes that h(k) is an integer value, usually in the range 0 to Hmax = 2 n−1, where n is chosen based on the desired range for the hash values. This method is best visualized by considering the range of all possible integer hash values 0 to Hmax  to be evenly distributed on a circle (or ring).\n",
      "\n",
      "The nodes in the distrib- uted system are then also located on the same ring; usually each node will have several locations on the ring (see Figure 24.2). The positioning of the points on the ring that represent the nodes is done in a psuedorandom manner. 898 Chapter 24 NOSQL Databases and Big Data Storage Systems An item ( k, v) will be stored on the node whose position in the ring follows the position of h(k) on the ring in a clockwise direction .\n",
      "\n",
      "In Figure 24.2(a), we assume there are three nodes in the distributed cluster labeled A, B, and C, where node C has a bigger capacity than nodes A and B. In a typical system, there will be many more nodes. On the circle, two instances each of A and B are placed, and three instances of C (because of its higher capacity), in a pseudorandom manner to cover the circle.\n",
      "\n",
      "■The h(k) values that fall in the parts of the circle marked as range 1  in Fig- ure 24.2(a) will have their (k, v) items stored in node A because that is the node whose label follows h(k) on the ring in a clockwise direction; those in range 2 are stored in node B; and those in range 3  are stored in node C. This scheme allows horizontal scalability  because when a new node is added to the distrib- uted system, it can be added in one or more locations on the ring depending on the node capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only a limited percentage of the (k, v) items will be reas-signed to the new node from the existing nodes based on the consistent hash-ing placement algorithm. Also, those items assigned to the new node may not all come from only one of the existing nodes because the new node can have multiple locations on the ring.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if a node D is added and it has two placements on the ring as shown in Figure 24.2(b), then some of the items from nodes B and C would be moved to node D. The items whose keys hash to range 4  on the circle (see Figure 24.2(b)) would be migrated to node D. This scheme also allows replication  by placing the number of specified replicas of an item on successive nodes on the ring in a clockwise direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sharding is built into the method, and different items in the store (file) are located on different nodes in the distributed cluster, which means the items are horizon-tally partitioned (sharded) among the nodes in the distributed system. When a node fails, its load of data items can be distributed to the other existing nodes whose labels follow the labels of the failed node in the ring. And nodes with higher capacity can have more locations on the ring, as illustrated by node C in Figure 24.2(a), and thus store more items than smaller-capacity nodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Consistency and versioning. Voldemort uses a method similar to the one developed for DynamoDB for consistency in the presence of replicas. Basi- cally, concurrent write operations are allowed by different processes so there could exist two or more different values associated with the same key at dif-ferent nodes when items are replicated. Consistency is achieved when the item is read by using a technique known as versioning and read repair . Con- current writes are allowed, but each write is associated with a vector clock value.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a read occurs, it is possible that different versions of the same value (associated with the same key) are read from different nodes. If the system can reconcile to a single final value, it will pass that value to the read; otherwise, more than one version can be passed back to the application, which will reconcile the various versions into one version based on the application semantics and give this reconciled value back to the nodes.\n",
      "\n",

The Google distributed storage system for big data, known as BigTable , is a well-known example of this class of NOSQL systems, and it is used in many Google applications that require large amounts of data storage, such as Gmail. Big-Table uses the Google File System  (GFS ) for data storage and distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "An open source system known as Apache Hbase  is somewhat similar to Google Big- Table, but it typically uses HDFS  (Hadoop Distributed File System ) for data stor- age. HDFS is used in many cloud computing applications, as we shall discuss in Chapter 25. Hbase can also use Amazon’s Simple Storage System  (known as S3) for data storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another well-known example of column-based NOSQL systems is Cassandra, which we discussed briefly in Section 24.4.3 because it can also be char-acterized as a key-value store. We will focus on Hbase in this section as an example of this category of NOSQL systems. BigTable (and Hbase) is sometimes described as a sparse multidimensional distrib- uted persistent sorted map , where the word map  means a collection of (key, value) pairs  (the key is mapped  to the value).\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the main differences that distinguish column-based systems from key-value stores (see Section 24.4) is the nature of the key. In column-based systems such as Hbase, the key is multidimensional  and so has several components: typically, a combination of table name, row key, column, and timestamp. As we shall see, the column is typically composed of two compo-nents: column family and column qualifier. We discuss these concepts in more detail next as they are realized in Apache Hbase.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.5.1 Hbase Data Model and Versioning Hbase data model. The data model in Hbase organizes data using the concepts of namespaces , tables , column families , column qualifiers , columns , rows , and data cells.

As with other NOSQL systems, unique keys are associated with stored data items for fast access, but the keys identify cells in the storage system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the focus is on high performance when storing huge amounts of data, the data model includes some storage-related concepts. We discuss the Hbase data modeling concepts and define the terminol-ogy next. It is important to note that the use of the words table , row, and column  is not identical to their use in relational databases, but the uses are related. ■Tables and Rows. Data in Hbase is stored in tables , and each table has a table name. Data in a table is stored as self-describing rows .\n",
      "\n",
      "Each row has a unique row key , and row keys are strings that must have the property that they can be lexicographically ordered, so characters that do not have a lexi-cographic order in the character set cannot be used as part of a row key. ■Column Families, Column Qualifiers, and Columns. A table is associated with one or more column families . Each column family will have a name, and the column families associated with a table must be specified  when the table is created and cannot be changed later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 24.3(a) shows how a table may be created; the table name is followed by the names of the column fami-lies associated with the table. When the data is loaded into a table, each col-umn family can be associated with many column qualifiers , but the column qualifiers are not specified  as part of creating a table. So the column qualifiers make the model a self-describing data model because the qualifiers can be dynamically specified as new rows are created and inserted into the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "A column  is specified by a combination of ColumnFamily:ColumnQualifier. Basically, column families are a way of grouping together related columns (attributes in relational terminology) for storage purposes, except that the column qualifier names are not specified during table creation. Rather, they are specified when the data is created and stored in rows, so the data is self- describing  since any column qualifier name can be used in a new row of data (see Figure 24.3(b)).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is important that the application program-mers know which column qualifiers belong to each column family, even though they have the flexibility to create new column qualifiers on the fly when new data rows are created. The concept of column family is somewhat similar to vertical partitioning  (see Section 23.2), because columns (attri- butes) that are accessed together because they belong to the same column family are stored in the same files. Each column family of a table is stored in its own files using the HDFS file system. ■Versions and Timestamps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hbase can keep several versions  of a data item, along with the timestamp  associated with each version. The timestamp is a long integer number that represents the system time when the version was created, so newer versions have larger timestamp values. Hbase uses mid- night ‘January 1, 1970 UTC’ as timestamp value zero, and uses a long integer that measures the number of milliseconds since that time as the system timestamp value (this is similar to the value returned by the Java utility  java.util.Date.getTime() and is also used in MongoDB).\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also possible for 902 Chapter 24 NOSQL Databases and Big Data Storage Systems the user to define the timestamp value explicitly in a Date format rather than using the system-generated timestamp. ■Cells. A cell holds a basic data item in Hbase. The key (address) of a cell is specified by a combination of (table, rowid, columnfamily, columnqualifier, timestamp). If timestamp is left out, the latest version of the item is retrieved unless a default number of versions is specified, say the latest three versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The default number of versions to be retrieved, as well as the default number of versions that the system needs to keep, are parameters that can be speci-fied during table creation. ■Namespaces.

The put operation is used for insert- ing new data or new versions of existing data items. The get operation is for retriev-ing the data associated with a single row in a table, and the scan  operation retrieves all the rows.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.5.3 Hbase Storage and Distributed System Concepts Each Hbase table is divided into a number of regions , where each region will hold a range  of the row keys in the table; this is why the row keys must be lexicographically ordered. Each region will have a number of stores , where each column family is assigned to one store within the region. Regions are assigned to region servers (storage nodes) for storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "A master server  (master node) is responsible for moni- toring the region servers and for splitting a table into regions and assigning regions to region servers. Hbase uses the Apache Zookeeper  open source system for services related to man- aging the naming, distribution, and synchronization of the Hbase data on the dis- tributed Hbase server nodes, as well as for coordination and replication services. Hbase also uses Apache HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) for distributed file services.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Hbase is built on top of both HDFS and Zookeeper. Zookeeper can itself have several replicas on several nodes for availability, and it keeps the data it needs in main memory to speed access to the master servers and region servers. We will not cover the many additional details about the distributed system architecture and components of Hbase; a full discussion is outside the scope of our presentation. Full documentation of Hbase is available online (see the bibliographic notes).\n",

      "24.6 NOSQL Graph Databases and Neo4j Another category of NOSQL systems is known as graph databases  or graph- oriented NOSQL  systems. The data is represented as a graph, which is a collection of vertices (nodes) and edges. Both nodes and edges can be labeled to indicate the types of entities and relationships they represent, and it is generally possible to store data associated with both individual nodes and individual edges. Many sys-tems can be categorized as graph databases.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will focus our discussion on one particular system, Neo4j, which is used in many applications. Neo4j is an open source system, and it is implemented in Java. We will discuss the Neo4j data model 904 Chapter 24 NOSQL Databases and Big Data Storage Systems in Section 24.6.1, and give an introduction to the Neo4j querying capabilities in Section 24.6.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 24.6.3 gives an overview of the distributed systems and some other characteristics of Neo4j.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.6.1 Neo4j Data Model The data model in Neo4j organizes data using the concepts of nodes  and relation- ships . Both nodes and relationships can have properties , which store the data items associated with nodes and relationships. Nodes can have labels ; the nodes that have the same label  are grouped into a collection that identifies a subset of the nodes in the database graph for querying purposes. A node can have zero, one, or several labels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relationships are directed; each relationship has a start node  and end node  as well as a relationship type , which serves a similar role to a node label by identifying similar relationships that have the same relationship type. Properties can be speci- fied via a map pattern , which is made of one or more “name : value” pairs enclosed in curly brackets; for example {Lname : ‘Smith’, Fname : ‘John’, Minit : ‘B’} . In conventional graph theory, nodes and relationships are generally called vertices and edges .\n",
      "\n",
      "The Neo4j graph data model somewhat resembles how data is repre- sented in the ER and EER models (see Chapters 3 and  4) , but with some notable differences. Comparing the Neo4j graph model with ER/EER concepts, nodes cor- respond to entities , node labels correspond to entity types and subclasses , relation- ships correspond to relationship instances , relationship types correspond to relationship types , and properties correspond to attributes . One notable difference is that a relationship is directed  in Neo4j, but is not in ER/EER.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another is that a node may have no label in Neo4j, which is not allowed in ER/EER because every entity must belong to an entity type. A third crucial difference is that the graph model of Neo4j is used as a basis for an actual high-performance distributed data- base system whereas the ER/EER model is mainly used for database design. Figure 24.4(a) shows how a few nodes can be created in Neo4j.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are various ways in which nodes and relationships can be created; for example, by calling appro- priate Neo4j operations from various Neo4j APIs. We will just show the high-level syntax for creating nodes and relationships; to do so, we will use the Neo4j CREATE command, which is part of the high-level declarative query language Cypher . Neo4j has many options and variations for creating nodes and relationships using various scripting interfaces, but a full discussion is outside the scope of our presentation. ■Labels and properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a node is created, the node label can be speci- fied. It is also possible to create nodes without any labels. In Figure 24.4(a), the node labels are EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT, PROJECT, and LOCATION, and the created nodes correspond to some of the data from the COMPANY database in Figure 5.6 with a few modifications; for example, we use EmpId instead of SSN, and we only include a small subset of the data for illustration purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Properties are enclosed in curly brackets { … }. It is possible that some nodes have multiple labels; for example the same node can be labeled as PERSON and EMPLOYEE and MANAGER by listing all the labels separated by the colon symbol as follows: PERSON:EMPLOYEE:MANAGER.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having multiple labels is similar to an entity belonging to an entity type (PERSON)  24.6 NOSQL Graph Databases and Neo4j  905 plus some subclasses of PERSON (namely EMPLOYEE and MANAGER) in the EER model (see Chapter 4) but can also be used for other purposes. ■Relationships and relationship types. Figure 24.4(b) shows a few example relationships in Neo4j based on the COMPANY database in Figure 5.6.\n",
      "\n",
      "The → specifies the direction of the relationship, but the relationship can be traversed in either direction. The relationship types (labels) in Figure 24.4(b) are WorksFor, Manager, LocatedIn, and WorksOn; only relationships with the relationship type WorksOn have properties (Hours) in Figure 24.4(b). ■Paths. A path  specifies a traversal of part of the graph. It is typically used as part of a query to specify a pattern, where the query will retrieve from the graph data that matches the pattern.\n",
      "\n",
      "A path is typically specified by a start node, followed by one or more relationships, leading to one or more end nodes that satisfy the pattern. It is somewhat similar to the concepts of path expressions that we discussed in Chapters 12 and  13 in the context of query languages for object databases (OQL) and XML (XPath and XQuery). ■Optional Schema. A schema  is optional in Neo4j. Graphs can be created and used without a schema, but in Neo4j version 2.0, a few schema-related functions were added.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main features related to schema creation involve creating indexes and constraints based on the labels and properties. For example, it is possible to create the equivalent of a key constraint on a prop-erty of a label, so all nodes in the collection of nodes associated with the label must have unique values for that property. ■Indexing and node identifiers. When a node is created, the Neo4j system creates an internal unique system-defined identifier for each node.\n",
      "\n",
      "To retrieve individual nodes using other properties of the nodes efficiently, the user can create indexes  for the collection of nodes that have a particular label. Typically, one or more of the properties of the nodes in that collection can be indexed. For example, Empid can be used to index nodes with the EMPLOYEE label, Dno to index the nodes with the DEPARTMENT label, and Pno to index the nodes with the PROJECT label.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.6.2 The Cypher Query Language of Neo4j Neo4j has a high-level query language, Cypher. There are declarative commands for creating nodes and relationships (see Figures 24.4(a) and (b)), as well as for finding nodes and relationships based on specifying patterns. Deletion and modification of data is also possible in Cypher. We introduced the CREATE command in the previous section, so we will now give a brief overview of some of the other features of Cypher.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Cypher query is made up of clauses . When a query has several clauses, the result from one clause can be the input to the next clause in the query. We will give a fla- vor of the language by discussing some of the clauses using examples. Our presenta-tion is not meant to be a detailed presentation on Cypher, just an introduction to some of the languages features. Figure 24.4(c) summarizes some of the main clauses that can be part of a Cyber query.\n",

      "It is also possible to limit the number of returned results by using the LIMIT clause as in query 5, which only returns the first 10 answers. Query 6 illustrates the use of WITH and aggregation, although the WITH clause can be used to separate clauses in a query even if there is no aggregation. Query 6 also illus- trates the WHERE clause to specify additional conditions, and the query returns the employees who work on more than two projects, as well as the number of projects each employee works on.\n",

Query 7 is similar to query 5 but returns the nodes and relationships only, and so the query result can be displayed as a graph using Neo4j’s visualization tool. It is also possible to add or remove labels and properties from nodes. Query 8 shows how to add more properties to a node by adding a Job property to an employee node.\n",

We dis-cuss some of the additional features of Neo4j in this subsection. ■Enterprise edition vs. community edition.\n",

      "Both editions support the Neo4j graph data model and storage system, as well as the Cypher graph query language, and several other interfaces, including a high-performance native API, language drivers for several popular programming languages, such as Java, Python, PHP, and the REST (Representational State Transfer) API. In addition, both editions support ACID properties. The enterprise edition supports additional features for enhancing performance, such as caching and clustering of data and locking. ■Graph visualization interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neo4j has a graph visualization interface, so that a subset of the nodes and edges in a database graph can be displayed as a graph. This tool can be used to visualize query results in a graph representation. ■Master-slave replication. Neo4j can be configured on a cluster of distrib- uted system nodes (computers), where one node is designated the master node. The data and indexes are fully replicated on each node in the cluster. Various ways of synchronizing the data between master and slave nodes can be configured in the distributed cluster.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Caching. A main memory cache can be configured to store the graph data for improved performance. ■Logical logs. Logs can be maintained to recover from failures.

      "24.7 Summary   In this chapter, we discussed the class of database systems known as NOSQL sys-tems, which focus on efficient storage and retrieval of large amounts of “big data.” Applications that use these types of systems include social media, Web links, user profiles, marketing and sales, posts and tweets, road maps and spatial data, and e-mail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The term NOSQL  is generally interpreted as Not Only SQL—rather than NO to SQL—and is meant to convey that many applications need systems other than traditional relational SQL systems to augment their data management needs. These systems are distributed databases or distributed storage systems, with a focus on semistructured data storage, high performance, availability, data replication, and scalability rather than an emphasis on immediate data consistency, powerful query languages, and structured data storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Section 24.1, we started with an introduction to NOSQL systems, their charac- teristics, and how they differ from SQL systems. Four general categories of NOSQL systems are document-based, key-value stores, column-based, and graph-based. In Section 24.2, we discussed how NOSQL systems approach the issue of consis-tency among multiple replicas (copies) by using the paradigm known as eventual consistency.\n",
      "\n",
      "We discussed the CAP theorem, which can be used to understand the emphasis of NOSQL systems on availability. In Sections 24.3 through  24.6, we presented an overview of each of the four main categories of NOSQL systems—starting with document-based systems in Section 24.3, followed by key-value stores in Section 24.4, then column-based systems in Section 24.5, and finally graph-based systems in Section 24.6.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also noted that some NOSQL systems may not fall neatly into a single category but rather use techniques that span two or more categories. Review Questions\n",
      "\n",
      "Big data  is becoming a popular and even a fashionable term. People use this term whenever a large amount of data is involved with some analysis; they think that using this term will make the analysis look like an advanced application. However, the term big data  legitimately refers to datasets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to capture, store, manage, and analyze.\n",
      "\n",
      "In today’s environment, the size of datasets that may be considered as big data ranges from terabytes (10 **12 bytes), or petabytes (10 **15 bytes), to exabytes (10 **18 bytes). The notion of what is Big data will depend on the industry, how data is used, how much historical data is involved and many other characteristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gartner Group, a popular enterprise-level organization that industry looks up to for learn- ing about trends, characterized big data in 2011 by the three V’s: volume, velocity, and variety. Other characteristics, such as veracity and value, have been added to the definition by other researchers. Let us briefly see what these stand for. Volume. The volume of data obviously refers to the size of data managed by the system. Data that is somewhat automatically generated tends to be voluminous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples include sensor data, such as the data in manufacturing or processing plants generated by sensors; data from scanning equipment, such as smart card and credit card readers; and data from measurement devices, such as smart meters or environmental recording devices. The industrial internet of things  (IIOT or IOT) is expected to bring about a revo- lution that will improve the operational efficiency of enterprises and open up new frontiers for harnessing intelligent technologies. The IOT will cause billions of devices to be connected to the Internet because these devices generate data continu-ously.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in gene sequencing, next generation sequencing (NGS) tech-nology means that the volume of gene sequence data will be increased exponentially. Many additional applications are being developed and are slowly becoming a real- ity.\n",
      "\n",
      "These applications include using remote sensing to detect underground sources of energy, environmental monitoring, traffic monitoring and regulation by auto-matic sensors mounted on vehicles and roads, remote monitoring of patients using special scanners and equipment, and tighter control and replenishment of invento-ries using radio-frequency identification (RFID) and other technologies. All these developments will have associated with them a large volume of data. Social net-works such as Twitter and Facebook have hundreds of millions of subscribers worldwide who generate new data with every message they send or post they make.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twitter hit a half billion tweets daily in October 2012. 5 The amount of data required to store one second of high-definition video may equal 2,000 pages of text data. Thus, the multimedia data being uploaded on YouTube and similar video hosting platforms is significantly more voluminous than simple numeric or text data. In 2010, enterprises stored over 13 exabytes (10 **18 bytes) of data, which amounts to over 50,000 times the amount of data stored by the Library of Congress.\n",

The definition of big data  goes beyond the dimension of volume; it includes the types and frequency of data that are disruptive to traditional database management tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mckinsey report on big data 7 described velocity as the speed at which data is created, accumulated, ingested, and processed. High velocity is attributed to data when we consider the typical speed of transactions on stock exchanges; this speed reaches billions of transactions per day on certain days. If we must process these transactions to detect potential fraud or we must process bil-lions of call records on cell phones daily to detect malicious activity, we face the velocity dimension.\n",
      "\n",
      "Real-time data and streaming data are accumulated by the likes of Twitter and Facebook at a very high velocity. Velocity is helpful in detecting trends among people that are tweeting a million tweets every three minutes. Pro-cessing of streaming data for analysis also involves the velocity dimension. Variety. Sources of data in traditional applications were mainly transactions involving financial, insurance, travel, healthcare, retail industries, and governmen-tal and judicial processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The types of sources have expanded dramatically and include Internet data (e.g., clickstream and social media), research data (e.g., sur-veys and industry reports), location data (e.g., mobile device data and geospatial data), images (e.g., surveillance, satellites and medical scanning), e-mails, supply chain data (e.g., EDI—electronic data interchange, vendor catalogs), signal data (e.g., sensors and RFID devices), and videos (YouTube enters hundreds of minutes of video every minute).\n",
      "\n",
      "Big data includes structured, semistructured, and unstruc-tured data (see discussion in Chapter 26) in different proportions based on context. Structured data feature a formally structured data model, such as the relational model, in which data are in the form of tables containing rows and columns, and a hierarchical database in IMS, which features record types as segments and fields within a record. Unstructured data have no identifiable formal structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "We discussed systems like MongoDB (in Chapter 24), which stores unstructured document-oriented data, and Neo4j, which stores data in the form of a graph. Other forms of unstructured data include e-mails and blogs, PDF files, audio, video, images, clickstreams, and Web contents. The advent of the World Wide Web in 1993–1994 led to tremen-dous growth in unstructured data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some forms of unstructured data may fit into a format that allows well-defined tags that separate semantic elements; this format may include the capability to enforce hierarchies within the data. XML is hierarchi-cal in its descriptive mechanism, and various forms of XML have come about in many domains; for example, biology (bioML—biopolymer markup language), GIS (gML—geography markup language), and brewing (BeerXML—language for exchange of brewing data), to name a few.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unstructured data constitutes the major challenge in today’s big data systems. Veracity. The veracity dimension of big data is a more recent addition than the advent of the Internet. Veracity has two built-in features: the credibility of the source, and the suitability of data for its target audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is closely related to trust; 7See Mckinsey (2013).916 Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop listing veracity as one of the dimensions of big data amounts to saying that data coming into the so-called big data applications have a variety of trustworthiness, and therefore before we accept the data for analytical or other applications, it must go through some degree of quality testing and credibility analysis. Many sources of data generate data that is uncertain, incomplete, and inaccurate, therefore making its veracity questionable.\n",
      "\n",
      "We now turn our attention to the technologies that are considered the pillars of big data technologies. It is anticipated that by 2016, more than half of the data in the world may be processed by Hadoop-related technologies. It is therefore important for us to trace the MapReduce/Hadoop revolution and understand how this tech-nology is positioned today. The historical development starts with the program-ming paradigm called MapReduce programming.\n",
      "\n",
      "25.2 Introduction to MapReduce and Hadoop In this section, we will introduce the technology for big data analytics and data pro- cessing known as Hadoop, an open source implementation of the MapReduce pro-gramming model. The two core components of Hadoop are the MapReduce programming paradigm and HDFS, the Hadoop Distributed File System. We will briefly explain the background behind Hadoop and then MapReduce. Then we will make some brief remarks about the Hadoop ecosystem and the Hadoop releases.\n",
      "\n",
      "25.2.1 Historical Background Hadoop has originated from the quest for an open source search engine. The first attempt was made by the then Internet archive director Doug Cutting and Univer-sity of Washington graduate student Mike Carafella. Cutting and Carafella devel-oped a system called Nutch that could crawl and index hundreds of millions of Web pages. It is an open source Apache project.\n",
      "\n",
      "8 After Google released the Google File System9 paper in October 2003 and the MapReduce programming paradigm paper10 in December 2004, Cutting and Carafella realized that a number of things they were doing could be improved based on the ideas in these two papers. They built an underlying file system and a processing framework that came to be known as Hadoop (which used Java as opposed to the C++ used in MapReduce) and ported Nutch on top of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2006, Cutting joined Yahoo, where there was an effort under way to build open source technologies using ideas from the Google File System and the MapReduce programming paradigm. Yahoo wanted to enhance its search pro-cessing and build an open source infrastructure based on the Google File System and MapReduce. Yahoo spun off the storage engine and the processing parts of Nutch as Hadoop  (named after the stuffed elephant toy of Cutting’s son).\n",
      "\n",
      "The 8For documentation on Nutch, see http:nutch.apache.org 9Ghemawat, Gbioff, and Leung (2003). 10Dean and Ghemawat (2004). 25.2 Introduction to MapReduce and Hadoop  917 initial requirements for Hadoop were to run batch processing using cases with a high degree of scalability. However, the circa 2006 Hadoop could only run on a handful of nodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, Yahoo set up a research forum for the company’s data sci-entists; doing so improved the search relevance and ad revenue of the search engine and at the same time helped to mature the Hadoop technology. In 2011, Yahoo spun off Hortonworks as a Hadoop-centered software company. By then, Yahoo’s infrastructure contained hundreds of petabytes of storage and 42,000 nodes in the cluster.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the years since Hadoop became an open source Apache project, thou-sands of developers worldwide have contributed to it. A joint effort by Google, IBM, and NSF used a 2,000-node Hadoop cluster at a Seattle data center and helped further universities’ research on Hadoop. Hadoop has seen tremendous growth since the 2008 launch of Cloudera as the first commercial Hadoop company and the subsequent mushrooming of a large number of startups.\n",
      "\n",
      "IDC, a software indus-try market analysis firm, predicts that the Hadoop market will surpass $800 million in 2016; IDC predicts that the big data market will hit $23 billion in 2016. For more details about the history of Hadoop, consult a four-part article by Harris. 11 An integral part of Hadoop is the MapReduce programming framework. Before we go any further, let us try to understand what the MapReduce programming paradigm is all about.\n",
      "\n",
      "We defer a detailed discussion of the HDFS file system to Section 25.3.\n",
      "\n",
      "25.2.2 MapReduce The MapReduce programming model and runtime environment was first described by Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat (Dean & Ghemawat (2004)) based on their work at Google. Users write their programs in a functional style of map  and reduce tasks, which are automatically parallelized and executed on large clusters of com-modity hardware. The programming paradigm has existed as far back as the lan-guage LISP, which was designed by John McCarthy in late 1950s.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the reincarnation of this way of doing parallel programming and the way this paradigm was implemented at Google gave rise to a new wave of thinking that contributed to the subsequent developments of technologies such as Hadoop. The runtime system handles many of the messy engineering aspects of parallelization, fault tolerance, data distribution, load balancing, and management of task communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "As long as users adhere to the contracts  laid out by the MapReduce system, they can just focus on the logical aspects of this program; this allows programmers without dis-tributed systems experience to perform analysis on very large datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The motivation behind the MapReduce system was the years spent by the authors and others at Google implementing hundreds of special-purpose computations on large datasets (e.g., computing inverted indexes from Web content collected via Web crawling; building Web graphs; and extracting statistics from Web logs, such as frequency distribution of search requests by topic, by region, by type of user, etc.).\n",
      "\n",

      "Issues of program control and data management, data distribution, parallelization of computation, and handling of failures became critically important. The MapReduce programming model and runtime environment was designed to cope with the above complexity. The abstraction is inspired by the map and reduce primitives present in LISP and many other functional languages. An underlying model of data is assumed; this model treats an object of interest in the form of a unique key that has associated content or value. This is the key-value pair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surpris-ingly, many computations can be expressed as applying a map operation to each logical “record” that produces a set of intermediate key-value pairs and then apply-ing a reduce operation to all the values that shared the same key (the purpose of sharing is to combine the derived data). This model allows the infrastructure to parallelize large computations easily and to use re-execution as the primary mecha-nism for fault tolerance. The idea of providing a restricted programming model so that the runtime can parallelize computations automatically is not new.\n",

      "MapReduce is the enhancement of those existing ideas. As it is understood today, MapReduce is a fault-tolerant implementation and a runtime environment that scales to thousands of processors.

The basic execution workflow of MapReduce is shown in Figure 25.1.Assume that we have a document and we want to make a list of words in it with their corresponding frequencies.\n",

      "25.3.1 HDFS Preliminaries The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is the file system component of Hadoop and is designed to run on a cluster of commodity hardware. HDFS is pat-terned after the UNIX file system; however, it relaxes a few POSIX (portable oper-ating system interface) requirements to enable streaming access to file system data. HDFS provides high-throughput access to large datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "HDFS stores file system 13Hadoop Wiki is at http://hadoop.apache.org/922 Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop metadata and application data separately. Whereas the metadata is stored on a dedicated server, called the NameNode, the application data is stored on other servers, called DataNodes. All servers are fully connected and communicate with each other using TCP-based protocols. To make data durable, the file content is replicated on multiple DataNodes, as in the Google File System.\n",
      "\n",
      "This not only increases reliability, but it also multiplies the bandwidth for data transfer and enables colocation of computation with data. It was designed with the following assumptions and goals: Hardware failure:  Using commodity hardware, failure of hardware is the norm rather than an exception. Therefore, with thousands of nodes, automatic detection and recovery from failures becomes a must. Batch processing:  HDFS has been primarily designed for batch rather than interactive use. High throughput is emphasized over low latency of data access. Full scans of files are typical.\n",
      "\n",
      "Large datasets:  HDFS was designed to support huge files in the hundreds of gigabytes to terabytes range. Simple coherency model:  HDFS applications need a one writer and many reader access models for files. File content cannot be updated, but only appended. This model alleviates coherency issues among copies of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "25.3.2 Architecture of HDFS HDFS has a master-slave architecture. The master server, called the NameNode , manages the file system storage area or namespace ; Clients access the namespace through the Namenode. The slaves called DataNodes  run on a cluster of commod- ity machines, usually one per machine. They manage the storage attached to the node that they run on. The namespace itself comprises Files and Directories.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Namenodes maintain inodes  (index nodes) about File and Directories with attri- butes like ownership, permissions, creation and access times, and disk space quotas. Using inodes, the mapping of File blocks to DataNodes is determined. DataNodes are responsible for serving read and write requests from clients. DataNodes per-form block creation, deletion, and replication operations as instructed by the NameNode. A cluster can have thousands of DataNodes and tens of thousands of HDFS clients simultaneously connected.\n",
      "\n",
      "To read a file, a client first connects to the NameNode and obtains the locations of the data blocks in the file it wants to access; it then connects directly with the DataNodes that house the blocks and reads the data. The architecture of HDFS has the following highlights: 1. HDFS allows a decoupling of metadata from data operations. Metadata operations are fast whereas data transfers are much slower.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the location of metadata and transfer of data are not decoupled, speed suffers in a dis- tributed environment because data transfer dominates and slows the response. 25.3 Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)  923 2. Replication is used to provide reliability and high availability. Each block is replicated (default is three copies) to a number of nodes in the cluster. The highly contentious files like MapReduce job libraries would have a higher number of replicas to reduce network traffic. 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "The network traffic is kept to a minimum. For reads, clients are directed to the closest DataNode. As far as possible, a local file system read is attempted and involves no network traffic; the next choice is a copy on a node on the same rack before going to another rack. For writes, to reduce network band-width utilization, the first copy is written to the same node as the client. For other copies, travel across racks is minimized. NameNode. The NameNode maintains an image  of the file system comprising i-nodes and corresponding block locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Changes to the file system are main- tained in a Write-ahead commit log (see the discussion of Write-ahead logs in Chapter 22) called the Journal . Checkpoints are taken for purposes of recovery; they represent a persistent record of the image without the dynamic information related to the block placement. Block placement information is obtained from the DataNodes periodically as described below. During Restart, the image is restored to the last checkpoint and the journal entries are applied to that image.\n",
      "\n",
      "A new checkpoint and empty journal are created so that the NameNode can start accepting new client requests. The startup time of a NameNode is proportional to the Journal file’s size. Merging the checkpoint with the Journal periodically reduces restart time. Note that with the above architecture, it is catastrophic to have any corruption of the Checkpoint or the Journal. To guard against corruption, both are written to multiple directories on different volumes. Secondary NameNodes. These are additional NameNodes that can be created to perform either the checkpointing role or a backup role.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Checkpoint node peri-odically combines existing checkpoint and journal files. In backup mode, it acts like another storage location for the Journal for the primary NameNode. The backup NameNode remains up-to-date with the file system and can take over on failure. In Hadoop V1, this takeover must be done manually. DataNodes: Blocks are stored on a DataNode in the node’s native file system. The NameNode directs clients to the DataNodes that contain a copy of the block they want to read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each block has its representation in two files in the native file system: a file containing the data and a second file containing the metadata, which includes the checksums for the block data and the block’s generation stamp. DataNodes and NameNodes do not communicate directly but via a so-called heartbeat mechanism , which refers to a periodic reporting of the state by the DataNode to the NameNode; the report is called a Block Report. The report contains the block id, the generation stamp, and the length for each block. The block locations are not part of the namespace image.\n",
      "\n",
      "They must be obtained from the block reports, and they change as blocks are moved around. The MapReduce Job Tracker, along with the 924 Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop NameNode, uses the latest block report information for scheduling purposes. In response to a heartbeat from the DataNode, the NameNode sends one of the following types of commands to the DataNode: ■Replicate a block to another node. ■Remove a block replica.\n",

      "25.3.3 File I/O Operations and Replica Management in HDFS HDFS provides a single-writer, multiple-reader model. Files cannot be updated, but only appended. A file consists of blocks. Data is written in 64-KB packets in a write pipeline , which is set up to minimize network utilization, as we described above. Data written to the last block becomes available only after an explicit hflush opera-tion. Simultaneous reading by clients is possible while data is being written.\n",
      "\n",
      "A checksum is generated and stored for each block and is verified by the client to detect corruption of data. Upon detection of a corrupt block, the Namenode is noti-fied; it initiates a process to replicate the block and instructs the Datanode to remove the corrupt block. During the read operation, an attempt is made to fetch a replica from as close a node as possible by ordering the nodes in ascending order of dis-tance from the client.\n",
      "\n",
      "A read fails when the Datanode is unavailable, when the checksum test fails, or when the replica is no longer on the Datanode. HDFS has been optimized for batch processing similar to MapReduce. Block Placement. Nodes of a Hadoop cluster are typically spread across many racks. They are normally organized such that nodes on a rack share a switch, and rack switches are connected to a high-speed switch at the upper level.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the rack level may have a 1-Gb switch, whereas at the top level there may be a 10-Gb switch. HDFS estimates the network bandwidth between Datanodes based on their distance. Datanodes on the same physical node have a distance of 0, on the same rack are distance 2 away, and on different racks are distance 4 away. The default HDFS block placement policy balances between minimizing the write cost and maximizing data reliability and availability as well as aggregate read bandwidth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Network bandwidth consumed is estimated based on distance among DataNodes. Thus, for DataNodes on the same physical node, the distance is 0, whereas on the same rack it is 2 and on a different rack it is 4. The ultimate goal of block placement is to minimize the write cost while maximizing data availability and reliability as well as available bandwidth for reading. Replicas are managed so that there is at least one on the original node of the client that created it, and others are distributed among other racks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tasks are preferred to be run on nodes where the data resides; three replicas gives the scheduler enough leeway to place tasks where the data is. Replica Management. Based on the block reports from the DataNodes, the NameNode tracks the number of replicas and the location of each block. A replica-tion priority queue contains blocks that need to be replicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "A background thread  25.3 Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)  925 monitors this queue and instructs a DataNode to create replicas and distribute them across racks. NameNode prefers to have as many different racks as possible to host replicas of a block. Overreplicated blocks cause some replicas to be removed based on space utilization of the DataNodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "25.3.4 HDFS Scalability Since we are discussing big data technologies in this chapter, it is apropos to discuss some limits of scalability in HDFS. Hadoop program management committee member Shvachko commented that the Yahoo HDFS cluster had achieved the fol-lowing levels as opposed to the intended targets (Shvachko, 2010). The numbers in parentheses are the targets he listed.\n",

      "\n",
      "Thus, Yahoo had come very close to its intended targets in 2010, with a smaller cluster of 4,000 nodes and fewer clients; but Yahoo had actually exceeded the target with respect to total amount of data handled. Some of the observations made by Shvachko (2010) are worth mentioning. They are based on the HDFS configuration used at Yahoo in 2010. We present the actual and estimated numbers below to give the reader a sense of what is involved in these gigantic data processing environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "■The blocksize used was 128K, and an average file contained 1.5 blocks. NameNode used about 200 bytes per block and an additional 200 bytes for an i-node. 100 million files referencing 200 million blocks would require RAM capacity exceeding 60 GB. ■For 100 million files with size of 200 million blocks and a replication factor of 3, the disk space required is 60 PB.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus a rule of thumb was proposed that 1 GB of RAM in NameNode roughly corresponds to 1 PB of data stor- age based on the assumption of 128K blocksize and 1.5 blocks per file. ■In order to hold 60 PB of data on a 10,000-node cluster, each node needs a capacity of 6 TB. This can be achieved by having eight 0.75-TB drives. ■The internal workload for the NameNode is block reports.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 3 reports per second containing block information on 60K blocks per report were received by the NameNode. ■The external load on the NameNode consisted of external connections and tasks from MapReduce jobs. This resulted in tens of thousands of simultane-ous connections. ■The Client Read consisted of performing a block lookup to get block loca- tions from the NameNode, followed by accessing the nearest replica of the block.\n",
      "\n",
      "A typical client (the Map job from an MR task) would read data from 1,000 files with an average reading of half a file each, amounting to 96 MB of data. This was estimated to take 1.45 seconds. At that rate, 100,000 clients would send 68,750 block-location requests per second to the NameNode.\n",

      "25.4.1 MapReduce Runtime The purpose of this section is to give a broad overview of the MapReduce runtime environment. For a detailed description, the reader is encouraged to consult White (2012). MapReduce is a master-slave system that usually runs on the same cluster as HDFS. Typically, medium to large Hadoop clusters consist of a two- or three-level architecture built with rack-mounted servers. JobTracker. The master process is called the JobTracker .\n",
      "\n",
      "It is responsible for man- aging the life cycle of Jobs and scheduling Tasks on the cluster. It is responsible for: ■Job submission, initializing a Job, providing Job status and state to both cli- ents and TaskTrackers (the slaves), and Job completion. ■Scheduling Map and Reduce tasks on the cluster. It does this using a plug- gable Scheduler. TaskTracker. The slave process is called a TaskTracker . There is one running on all Worker nodes  of the cluster.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Map-Reduce tasks run on Worker nodes. TaskTracker daemons running on these nodes register with the JobTracker on startup. They run tasks that the JobTracker assigns to them. Tasks are run in a sepa- rate process on the node; the life cycle of the process is managed by the TaskTracker. The TaskTracker creates the task process, monitors its execution, sends periodic status heartbeats to the JobTracker, and under failure conditions can kill the pro- cess at the request of the JobTracker.\n",
      "\n",
      "The TaskTracker provides services to the Tasks, the most important of which is the Shuffle , which we describe in a sub- section below. A. Overall flow of a MapReduce Job A MapReduce job goes through the processes of Job Submission, Job Initializa- tion, Task Assignment, Task Execution, and finally Job Completion. The Job Tracker and Task Tracker we described above are both involved in these. We briefly review them below. Job submission  A client submits a Job to the JobTracker .\n",
      "\n",
      "The Job package con- tains the executables (as a jar), any other components (files, jars archives) needed to execute the Job, and the InputSplits for the Job. Job initialization  The JobTracker accepts the Job and places it on a Job Queue. Based on the input splits, it creates map tasks for each split. A number of reduce tasks are created based on the Job configuration. Task assignment  The JobTracker’s scheduler assigns Task to the TaskTracker from one of the running Jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Hadoop v1, TaskTrackers have a fixed number of slots for map tasks and for reduce tasks. The Scheduler takes the location informa-tion of the input files into account when scheduling tasks on cluster nodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Task execution  Once a task has been scheduled on a slot, the TaskTracker manages the execution of the task: making all Task artifacts available to the 928 Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop Task process, launching the Task JVM, monitoring the process and coordinat- ing with the JobTracker to perform management operations like cleanup on Task exit, and killing Tasks on failure conditions. The TaskTracker also pro-vides the Shuffle Service  to Tasks; we describe this when we discuss the Shuffle Procedure below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Job completion  Once the last Task in a Job is completed, the JobTracker runs the Job cleanup task (which is used to clean up intermediate files in both HDFS and the local file systems of TaskTrackers). B. Fault Tolerance in MapReduce There are three kinds of failures: failure of the Task, failure of the TaskTracker, and failure of the JobTracker. Task failure  This can occur if the Task code throws a Runtime exception, or if the Java Virtual Machine crashes unexpect edly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another issue is when the Task- Tracker does not receive any updates from the Task process for a while (the time period is configurable). In all these cases the TaskTracker notifies the JobTracker that the Task has failed. When the JobTracker is notified of the failure, it will reschedule execution of the task. TaskTracker failure  A TaskTracker process may crash or become disconnected from the JobTracker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the JobTracker marks a TaskTracker as failed, any map tasks completed by the TaskTracker are put back on the queue to be rescheduled. Similarly, any map task or reduce task in progress on a failed Task-Tracker is also rescheduled. JobTracker failure  In Hadoop v1, JobTracker failure is not a recoverable failure. The JobTracker is a Single Point of Failure. The JobTracker has to be manually restarted. On restart all the running jobs have to be resubmitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is one of the drawbacks of Hadoop v1 that have been addressed by the next generation of Hadoop MapReduce called YARN. Semantics in the presence of failure  When the user-supplied map and reduce operators are deterministic functions of their input values, the MapReduce sys-tem produces the same output as would have been produced by a nonfaulting sequential execution of the entire program. Each task writes its output to a pri-vate task directory.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the JobTracker receives multiple completions for the same Task, it ignores all but the first one. When a Job is completed, Task outputs are moved to the Job output directory. C. The Shuffle Procedure A key feature of the MapReduce (MR) programming model is that the reducers get all the rows for a given key together. This is delivered by what is called the MR shuffle . The shuffle is divided into the Map, Copy, and Reduce phases.\n",

The Partitioner  is a pluggable interface that is asked to choose a Reducer for a given Key value and the number of reducers in the Job.\n",
      "\n",
      "The partitioned rows are sorted on their key values. They can further be sorted on a provided Comparator  so that rows with the same key have a stable sort order. This is used for Joins to ensure that for rows with the same key value, rows from the same table are bunched together. Another interface that can be plugged in is the Combiner  interface. This is used to reduce the number of rows output per key from a mapper and is done by applying a reduce operation on each Mapper for all rows with the same key.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the Map phase, several iterations of partitioning, sorting, and combining may happen. The end result is a single local file per reducer that is sorted on the Key. Copy phase:  The Reducers pull their files from all the Mappers as they become available. These are provided by the JobTracker in Heartbeat responses. Each Mapper has a set of listener threads that service Reducer requests for these files. Reduce phase:  The Reducer reads all its files from the Mappers.\n",
      "\n",
      "All files are merged before streaming them to the Reduce function. There may be multiple stages of merging, depending on how the Mapper files become available. The Reducer will avoid unnecessary merges; for example, the last N files will be merged as the rows are being streamed to the Reduce function. D. Job Scheduling The JobTracker  in MR 1.0 is responsible for scheduling work on cluster nodes. Clients’ submitted jobs are added to the Job Queue of the JobTracker.\n",
      "\n",
      "The initial versions of Hadoop used a FIFO scheduler that scheduled jobs sequentially as they were submitted. At any given time, the cluster would run the tasks of a single Job. This caused undue delays for short jobs like ad-hoc hive queries if they had to wait for long-running machine learning–type jobs. The wait times would exceed runtimes, and the throughput on the cluster would suffer. Addi-tionally, the cluster also would remain underutilized.\n",
      "\n",
      "We briefly describe two other types of schedulers, called the Fair Scheduler and Capacity Scheduler, that alleviate this situation. Fair Scheduler:  The goal of Fair Scheduler is to provide fast response time to small jobs in a Hadoop shared cluster. Fo r this scheduler, jobs are grouped into Pools. The capacity of the cluster is evenly shared among the Pools. At any given time the resources of the cluster are evenly divided among the Pools, thereby utilizing the capacity of the cluster evenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "A typical way to set up Pools is to assign each user a Pool and assign certain Pools a minimum number of slots. Capacity Scheduler:  The Capacity Scheduler is geared to meet the needs of large Enterprise customers. It is designed to allow multiple tenants to share resources of a large Hadoop cluster by allocating resources in a timely manner under a given set of capacity constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "In large enterprises, individual depart-ments are apprehensive of using one centralized Hadoop cluster for concerns 930 Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop that they may not be able to meet the service-level agreements (SLAs) of their applications. The Capacity Scheduler is designed to give each tenant guarantees about cluster capacity using the following provisions: /box4There is support for multiple queues, with hard and soft limits in terms of fraction of resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "/box4Access control lists (ACLs) are used that determine who can submit, view, and modify the Jobs in a queue. /box4Excess capacity is evenly distributed among active Queues. /box4Tenants have usage limits; such limits prevent tenants from monopoliz- ing the cluster.\n",
      "\n",
      "25.4.2 Example: Achieving Joins in MapReduce To understand the power and utility of the MapReduce programming model, it is instructive to consider the most important operation of relational algebra, called Join, which we introduced in Chapter 6. We discussed its use via SQL queries (Chapters 7 and 8) and its optimization (Chapters 18 and 19).\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us consider the problem of joining two relations R(A, B)  with S(B, C)  with the join condition R.A = S.B . Assume both tables reside on HDFS. Here we list the many strategies that have been devised to do equi-joins in the MapReduce environment. Sort-Merge Join. The broadest strategy for performing a join is to utilize the Shuffle to partition and sort the data and have the reducers merge and generate the output.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can set up an MR job that reads blocks from both tables in the Map phase. We set up a Partitioner  to hash partition rows from R and S on the value of the B  column. The key output from the Map phase includes a table tag. So the key has the form (tag, (key)). In MR, we can configure a custom Sort for the Job’s shuffle; the custom Sort sorts the rows that have the same key. In this case, we Sort rows with the same B value based on the tag.\n",
      "\n",
      "We give the smaller table a tag of 0 and the larger table a tag of 1. So a reducer will see all rows with the same B value in the order: smaller table rows first, then larger table rows. The Reducer can buffer smaller table rows; once it starts to receive large table rows, it can do an in-memory cross-product with the buffered small table rows to generate the join output. The cost of this strategy is dominated by the shuffle cost, which will write and read each row multiple times. Map-Side Hash Join.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the case when one of R or S is a small table that can be loaded in the memory of each task, we can have the Map phase operate only on the large table splits. Each Map task can read the entire small table and create an in-memory hash map based on B as the hash key. Then it can perform a hash join. This is similar to Hash Joins in databases. The cost of this task is roughly the cost of read-ing the large table. Partition Join.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assume that both R and S are stored in such a way that they are partitioned on the join keys. Then all rows in each Split belong to a certain identifi-able range of the domain of the join field, which is B in our example. Assume both R and S are stored as p files. Suppose file ( i) contains rows such that (Value B )mod  25.4 MapReduce: Additional Details  931 p = i.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we only need to join the ith file of \\(R\\) R with the corresponding ith file of S. One way to do this is to perform a variation of the Map-Side join we discussed above: have the Mapper handling the ith partition of the larger table read the ith partition from the smaller table. This strategy can be expanded to work even when the two tables do not have the same number of partitions. It is sufficient for one to be a multiple of the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if table A is divided into two partitions and table B is divided into four partitions, then partition 1 from table A needs to join with partitions 1 and 3 of B, and partition 2 of A needs to join with partitions 2 and 4 of B. The opportunity to perform Bucketed Join (see below) is also common: for example, assume R and S are outputs of previous sort-merge joins. The output of the sort-merge join is partitioned in the joining expressions. Further joining this dataset allows us to avoid a shuffle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bucket Joins. This is a combination of Map-Side and Partition Joins. In this case only one relation, say the right side relation, is Partitioned. We can then run Map-pers on the left side relation and perform a Map Join against each Partition from the right side. N-Way Map-Side Joins.\n",
      "\n",
      "A join on R(A, B, C, D ), S(B, E ), and T(C, F) can be achieved in one MR job provided the rows for a key for all small tables can be buffered in memory. The join is typical in Data Warehouses (see Chapter 29), where R is a fact table and S and T are dimension tables whose keys are B and C, respectively. Typi- cally, in a Data Warehouse query filters are specified on Dimensional Attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence each Map task has enough memory to hold the hash map of several small Dimensional tables. As Fact table rows are being read into the Map task, they can be hash joined with all the dimensional tables that the Map task has read into memory. Simple N-Way Joins. A join on R(A, B), S(B, C), and T(B, D) can be achieved in one MR job provided the rows for a key for all small tables can be buffered in mem-ory. Suppose R is a large table and S and T are relatively smaller tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then it is typically the case that for any given key value B, the number of rows in S or T will fit in a Task’s memory. Then, by giving the large table the largest tag, it is easy to gen-eralize the Sort-Merge join to an N-way join where the joining expressions are the same. In a Reducer for a key value of B, the reducer will first receive the S rows, then the T rows, and finally the R rows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the assumption is that there aren’t a large number of S and T rows, the reducer can cache them. As it receives R rows, it can do a cross product with the cached S and T rows and output the result of join. In addition to the above strategies for performing joins using the MapReduce para- digm, algorithms have been proposed for other types joins (e.g., the general multi-way natural join with special cases of chain-join or star-join in data warehouses have been shown to be handled as a single MR job).\n",
      "\n",
      "14 Similarly, algorithms have been proposed to deal with skew in the join attributes (e.g., in a sales fact table, certain days may have a disproportionate number of transactions).\n",
      "\n",
      "For joins on attributes with skew, a modified algorithm would let the Partitioner  assign unique values to the 14See Afrati and Ullman (2010).932 Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop data having a large number of entries and let them be handled by Reduce tasks, whereas the rest of the values may undergo hash partitioning as usual. This discussion should provide the reader with a good sense of the many possibili- ties of implementing Join strategies on top of MapReduce.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are other factors affecting performance, such as row versus columnar storage and pushing predicates down to storage handlers. These are beyond our scope of discussion here. Inter-ested readers will find ongoing research publications in this area that are similar to Afrati and Ullman (2010). The purpose of this section is to highlight two major developments that have impacted the big data community by providing high-level interfaces on top of the core technology of Hadoop and MapReduce. We will give a brief overview of the language Pig Latin and the system Hive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apache Pig. Pig 15 was a system that was designed at Yahoo Research to bridge the gap between declarative-style interfaces such as SQL, which we studied in the con-text of the relational model, and the more rigid low-level procedural-style program-ming style required by MapReduce that we described in Section 25.2.2. Whereas it is possible to express very complex analysis in MR, the user must express programs as a one-input, two-stage (map and reduce) process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, MR provides no methods for describing a complex data flow that applies a sequence of transforma-tions on the input. There is no standard way to do common data transformation operations like Projections, Filtering, Grouping, and Joining. We saw all these operations being expressed declaratively in SQL in Chapters 7 and 8. However, there is a community of users and programmers that thinks more procedurally.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the developers of Pig invented the language Pig Latin to fill in the “sweet spot” between SQL and MR. We show an example of a simple Group By query expressed in Pig Latin in Olston et al. (2008): There is a table of urls: (url,category.pagerank). We wish to find, for categories having a large number of URLs, the average page- rank of the high-pagerank URLs in that category. This requires a grouping of URLs by category.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SQL query that expresses this requirement may look like: SELECT category, AVG(pagerank) FROM urls WHERE pagerank > 0.2 GROUP BY category HAVING COUNT( *) > 10 **6 The same query in Pig Latin is written as: good_urls = FILTER urls BY pagerank > 0.2; groups = GROUP good_urls BY category;big_groups = FILTER groups BY COUNT(good_urls)> 10 **6; output =  FOREACH big_groups GENERATE category, AVG(good_urls.pagerank); 15See Olston et al.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2008). 25.4 MapReduce: Additional Details  933 As shown by this example, a Pigscript written using the scripting language Pig Latin is a sequence of data transformation steps. On each step, a basic transformation like Filter, Group By, or Projection is expressed. The script resembles a query plan for the SQL query similar to the plans we discussed in Chapter 19. The language sup-ports operating on nested data structures like JSON (Java Script Object Notation) and XML.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has an extensive and extendible function library, and also an ability to bind schema to data very late or not at all. Pig was designed to solve problems such as ad hoc analyses of Web logs and click- streams. The logs and clickstreams typically require custom processing at row level as well as at an aggregate level. Pig accommodates user-defined functions (UDFs) extensively.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also supports a nested data model with the following four types: Atoms:  Simple atomic values such as a number or a string Tuples:  A sequence of fields, each of which can be of any permissible type Bag:  A collection of tuples with possible duplicates Map:  A collection of data items where each item has a key that allows direct access to it Olston et al. (2008) demonstrates interesting applications on logs using Pig. An example is analysis of activity logs for a search engine over any time period (day, week, month, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "to calculate frequency of search terms by a user’s geographic loca-tion. Here the functions needed include mapping IP addresses to geo-locations and using n-gram extraction. Another application involves co-grouping search queries of one period with those of another period in the past based on search terms. Pig was architected so that it could run on different execution environments. In implementing Pig, Pig Latin was compiled into physical plans that were translated into a series of MR jobs and run in Hadoop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pig has been a useful tool for enhanc-ing programmers’ productivity in the Hadoop environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "25.4.3 Apache Hive Hive was developed at Facebook16 with a similar intent—to provide a higher level interface to Hadoop using SQL-like queries and to support the processing of aggre-gate analytical queries that are typical in data warehouses (see Chapter 29). Hive remains a primary interface for accessing data in Hadoop at Facebook; it has been adopted widely in the open source community and is undergoing continuous improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hive went beyond Pig Latin in that it provided not only a high-level language interface to Hadoop, but a layer that makes Hadoop look like a DBMS with DDL, metadata repository, JDBC/ODBC access, and an SQL compiler. The architecture and components of Hive are shown in Figure 25.2. Figure 25.2 shows Apache Thrift as interface in Hive. Apache Thrift defines an Interface Definition Language (IDL) and Communication Protocol used to develop 16See Thusoo et al.\n",

It comes with a runtime and code generation engine that can be used to develop remote services in many languages, including Java, C++, Python, and Ruby. Apache Thrift supports JSON-based and binary protocols; it supports http, socket, and file transports. The Hive query language HiveQL includes a subset of SQL that includes all types of joins, Group By operations, as well as useful functions related to primitive and com-plex data types.\n",
      "\n",
      "We comment below on some of the highlights of the Hive system. Interfacing with HDFS: ■Tables in Hive are linked to directories in HDFS. Users can define parti- tions within tables. For example, a Web log table can be partitioned by day and within day by the hour. Each partition level introduces a level of direc- tories in HDFS. A table may also be stored as bucketed  on a set of columns. This means that the stored data is physically partitioned by the column(s).\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, within an hour directory, the data may be bucketed  by  Userid; this means that each hour’s data is stored in a set of files, each file rep-resents a bucket of Users, and the bucket is based on the hashing of the Userid column. Users can specify how many buckets the data should be divided into. ■The SerDe (Serialization/Deserialization) plugin architecture lets users specify how data in native file formats is exposed as rows to Hive SQL oper-ators.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hive comes with a rich set of SerDe functions and supported File formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, SequenceFile); columnar formats (e.g., RCFile, ORCFile, Parquet); and support for Avro—another data serialization sys-tem. The different StorageHandlers  expand on the SerDe mechanism to allow pluggable behavior for how data is read/written and the ability to push predicates  down to the Storage Handler for early evaluation.\n",

      "\n",
      "Support of SQL and Optimizations in Hive: Hive incorporated the concepts of Logical and Physical Optimizations similar to those used in optimization of SQL que-ries, which we discussed in Chapters 18 and 19. Early on, there was support for logical optimizations such as pruning unneeded columns and pushing selection predicates down into the query tree. Physical optimizations of converting sort-merge joins to Map-side joins based on user hints and data file sizes have also been incorporated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hive started with support for a subset of SQL-92 that included SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, and filters based on conditions in the WHERE clause. Hive users can express complex SQL commands in Hive. Early in its development, Hive was able to run the 22 TPCH benchmark queries (Transaction Processing Performance Council benchmark for decision support), although with considerable manual rewriting. Significant strides have been made in language support and in optimizer and run- time techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a sampling of those improvements: ■Hive SQL has added many analytic features of SQL, such as subquery predicates, Common Table expressions (this is the WITH clause in SQL that allows users to name common subquery blocks and reference them multiple times in the query; these expressions can be considered query-level views), aggregates over a certain window within the data, Rollups (which refer to higher aggregation levels), and Grouping sets (this capability allows you to express multiple levels of aggrega-tion in one Group By level).\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider, for example, Group By Grouping Sets ((year, month), (dayofweek)); this expresses aggregates both at the (Year, Month) level and also by DayOfWeek. A full set of SQL data types, including varchars, numeric types, and dates, is now supported. Hive also supports the common Change Data Capture ETL flow via Insert and Update statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a Data Warehouse, the process of delivering slowly changing Dimensions (e.g., customers in a Retail Data Warehouse) requires a complex dataflow of identi-fying new and updated records in that Dimension. This is called the Change Data Capture (CDC) process. By adding Insert and Update statements in Hive, it is possible to model and execute CDC processes in Hive SQL.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Hive now has a greatly expanded set of DDLs for expressing grants and priv- ileges in terms of discretionary access control (see Section 30.2). ■Several standard database optimizations have been incorporated, including Partition pruning, Join reordering, Index rewrite, and Reducing the number of MR jobs. Very large tables, like Fact tables in Data Warehouses, are typi- cally partitioned. Time is probably the most common attribute used for parti- tioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "With HDFS being used as the storage layer, users tend to retain data for long time periods. But a typical Warehouse will only include the most cur-rent time periods (e.g., the last quarter or current year). The time periods are specified as filters in the Query. Partition Pruning is the technique of extracting relevant predicates from the Query filters and translating them to a list of 936 Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop Table partitions that need to be read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, this has a huge impact on performance and cluster utilization: Instead of scanning all partitions retained for the last N years, only the partitions from the last few weeks/months are scanned. Work in progress includes collecting column- and table-level statis-tics and generating plans based on a cost model that uses these statistics (simi-lar to what we considered for RDBMSs in Chapter 19).\n",
      "\n",
      "■Hive now supports Tez as a runtime environment that has significant advan- tages over MR, including that there is no need to write to disk between jobs; and there is no restriction on one-input, two-stage processes. There is also active work to support Hive on Spark, a new technology that we briefly mention in Section 25.6.\n",
      "\n",
      "25.4.4 Advantages of the Hadoop/MapReduce Technology Hadoop version 1 was optimized for batch processing on very large datasets. Vari-ous factors contribute to its success: 1. The disk seek rate is a limiting factor when we deal with petabyte-level work-loads. Seek is limited by the disk mechanical structure, whereas the transfer speed is an electronic feature and increasing steadily. (See Section 16.2 for a discussion of disk drives.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The MapReduce model of scanning datasets in parallel alleviates this situation. For instance, scanning a 100-TB dataset sequentially using 1 machine at a rate of 50 Mbps will take about 24 days to complete. On the other hand, scanning the same data using 1,000 machines in parallel will just take 35 minutes. Hadoop recommends very large block sizes, 64 MB or higher. So when scanning datasets, the percentage of time spent on disk seeks is negligible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlimited disk seek rates combined with processing large datasets in chunks and in parallel is what drives the scal-ability and speed of the MapReduce model. 2. The MapReduce model allows handling of semistructured data and key-value datasets more easily compared to traditional RDBMSs, which require a predefined schema. Files such as very large logfiles present a particular problem in RDBMSs because they need to be parsed in multiple ways before they can be analyzed. 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "The MapReduce model has linear scalability in that resources can be added to improve job latency and throughput in a linear fashion. The failure model is simple, and individual failed jobs can be rerun without a major impact on the whole job.\n",
      "\n",
      "25.5 Hadoop v2 alias YAR N In previous sections, we discussed Hadoop development in detail. Our discussion included the core concepts of the MapReduce paradigm for programming and the HDFS underlying storage infrastructure. We also discussed high-level interfaces like Pig and Hive that are making it possible to do SQL-like, high level data process- ing on top of the Hadoop framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now we turn our attention to subsequent developments, which are broadly called Hadoop v2 or MRv2 or YARN (Yet Another  25.5 Hadoop v2 alias YARN  937 Resource Negotiator). First, we point out the shortcomings of the Hadoop v1 plat- form and the rationale behind YARN.\n",
      "\n",
      "25.5.1 Rationale behind YARN Despite the success of Hadoop v1, user experience with Hadoop v1 in enterprise applications highlighted some shortcomings and suggested that an upgrade of Hadoop v1 might be necessary: ■As cluster sizes and the number of users grew, the JobTracker became a bot- tleneck. It was always known to be the Single Point of Failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "■With a static allocation of resources to map and reduce functions, utilization of the cluster of nodes was less than desirable ■HDFS was regarded as a single storage system for data in the enterprise. Users wanted to run different types of applications that would not easily fit into the MR model. Users tended to get around this limitation by running Map-only Jobs, but this only compounded scheduling and utilization issues. ■On large clusters, it became problematic to keep up with new open source versions of Hadoop, which were released every few months.\n",
      "\n",
      "The above reasons explain the rationale for developing version 2 of Hadoop. Some of the points mentioned in the previous list warrant a more detailed discussion, which we provide next. Multitenancy: Multitenancy refers to accommodating multiple tenants/users con- currently so that they can share resources. As the cluster sizes grew and the number of users increased, several communities of users shared the Hadoop cluster. At Yahoo, the original solution to this problem was Hadoop on Demand , which was based on the Torque resource manager and Maui scheduler.\n",
      "\n",
      "Users could set up a separate cluster for each Job or set of Jobs. This had several advantages: ■Each cluster could run its own version of Hadoop. ■JobTracker failures were isolated to a single cluster. ■Each user/organization could make independent decisions on the size and configuration of its cluster depending on expected workloads. But Yahoo abandoned Hadoop on Demand for the following reasons: ■Resource allocation was not based on data locality.\n",
      "\n",
      "So most reads and writes from HDFS were remote accesses, which negated one of the key benefits of the MR model of mostly local data accesses. ■The allocation of a cluster was static. This meant large parts of a cluster were mostly idle: /box4Within an MR job, the reduce slots were not usable during the Map phase and the map slots were not usable during the Reduce phase. When using higher level languages like Pig and Hive, each script or query spawned multiple Jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since cluster allocation was static, the maximum nodes needed in any Job had to be acquired upfront.938 Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop /box4Even with the use of Fair or Capacity scheduling (see our discussion in Section 25.4.2), dividing the cluster into fixed map and reduce slots meant the cluster was underutilized. ■The latency involved in acquiring a cluster was high—a cluster would be granted only when enough nodes were available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Users started extending the lifetime of clusters and holding the clusters longer than they needed. This affected cluster utilization negatively. JobTracker Scalability. As the cluster sizes increased beyond 4,000 nodes, issues with memory management and locking made it difficult to enhance JobTracker to handle the workload. Multiple options were considered, such as holding data about Jobs in memory, limiting the number of tasks per Job, limiting the number of Jobs submitted per user, and limiting the number of concurrently running jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of these seemed to fully satisfy all users; JobTracker often ran out of memory. A related issue concerned completed Jobs. Completed jobs were held in JobTracker and took up memory. Many schemes attempted to reduce the number and memory footprint of completed Jobs. Eventually, a viable solution was to offload this func-tion to a separate Job History daemon. As the number of TaskTrackers grew, the latencies for heartbeats (signals from TaskTracker to JobTracker) were almost 200 ms.\n",
      "\n",
      "This meant that heartbeat intervals for TaskTrackers could be 40 seconds or more when there were more than 200 task trackers in the cluster. Efforts were made to fix this but were eventually abandoned. JobTracker: Single Point of Failure. The recovery model of Hadoop v1 was very weak. A failure of JobTracker would bring down the entire cluster. In this event, the state of running Jobs was lost, and all jobs would have to be resubmitted and JobTracker restarted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Efforts to make the information about completed jobs persist did not succeed. A related issue was to deploy new versions of the software. This required scheduling a cluster downtime, which resulted in backlogs of jobs and a subsequent strain on JobTracker upon restart. Misuse of the MapReduce Programming Model. MR runtime was not a great fit for iterative processing; this was particularly true for machine learning algo-rithms in analytical workloads. Each iteration is treated as an MR job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Graph algo-rithms are better expressed using a bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) model, which uses message passing as opposed to the Map and Reduce primitives. Users got around these impediments by inefficient alternatives such as implementing machine learning algorithms as long-running Map-only jobs. These types of jobs initially read data from HDFS and executed the first pass in parallel; but then exchanged data with each other outside the control of the framework. Also, the fault tolerance was lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "The JobTracker was not aware of how these jobs operated; this lack of awareness led to poor utilization and instability in the cluster. Resource Model Issues. In Hadoop v1, a node is divided into a fixed number of Map and Reduce slots. This led to cluster underutilization because idle slots could  25.5 Hadoop v2 alias YARN  939 not be used. Jobs other than MR could not run easily on the nodes because the node capacity remained unpredictable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aforementioned issues illustrate why Hadoop v1 needed upgrading. Although attempts were made to fix in Hadoop v1 many of the issues listed above, it became clear that a redesign was needed. The goals of the new design were set as follows: ■To carry forward the scalibility and locality awareness of Hadoop v1. ■To have multitenancy and high cluster utilization. ■To have no single point of failure and to be highly available. ■To support more than just MapReduce jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cluster resources should not be modeled as static map and reduce slots. ■To be backward compatible, so existing jobs should run as they are and pos- sibly without any recompilation. The outcome of these was YARN or Hadoop v2, which we discuss in the next section.\n",
      "\n",
      "25.5.2 YARN Architecture Overview. Having provided the motivation behind upgrading Hadoop v1, we now discuss the detailed architecture of the next generation of Hadoop, which is popularly known as MRv2, MapReduce 2.0, Hadoop v2, or YARN.17 The central idea of YARN is the separation of cluster Resource Management from Jobs man-agement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, YARN introduces the notion of an ApplicationMaster , which is now responsible for managing work (task data flows, task lifecycles, task failover, etc.). MapReduce is now available as a service/application provided by the MapReduce ApplicationMaster . The implications of these two decisions are far-reaching and are central to the notion of a data service operating system. Figure 25.3 shows a high-level schematic diagram of Hadoop v1 and Hadoop v2 side by side.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ResourceManager  and the per worker node NodeManager  together form the platform on which any Application can be hosted on YARN. The Resource Manager manages the cluster, doling out Resources based on a pluggable scheduling policy (such as a fairness policy or optimizing cluster utilization policy). It is also respon- sible for the lifecycle of nodes in the cluster in that it will track when nodes go down, when nodes become unreachable, or when new nodes join. Node failures are reported to the ApplicationMasters that had containers on the failed node.\n",
      "\n",
      "New nodes become available for use by ApplicationMasters. ApplicationMasters send ResourceRequests to the ResourceManager which then responds with cluster Container leases.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Container  is a lease by the Resource- Manager to the ApplicationManager to use certain amount of resources on a node 17See the Apache website: http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/ YARN.html for up-to-date documentation on YARN.940 Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop of the cluster. The ApplicationMaster presents a Container Launch Context to the NodeManager for the node that this lease references.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Launch Context, in addition to containing the lease, also specifies how to run the process for the task and how to get any resources like jars, libs for the process, environment variables, and security tokens. A node has a certain processing power in terms of number of cores, memory, network bandwidth, etc. Currently, YARN only considers mem-ory. Based on its processing power, a node can be divided into an interchangeable set of containers. Once an ApplicationMaster receives a container lease, it is free to schedule work on it as it pleases.\n",
      "\n",
      "ApplicationMasters, based on their workload, can continuously change their Resource requirements. The ResourceManager bases its scheduling decisions purely on these requests, on the state of the cluster, and on the cluster’s scheduling policy. It is not aware of the actual tasks being carried out on the nodes. The responsibility of managing and analyzing the actual work is left to ApplicationMasters. The NodeManager  is responsible for managing Containers on their nodes. Con- tainers are responsible for reporting on the node health.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also handle the pro-cedure for nodes joining the cluster. Containers provide the Container Launch service to ApplicationMasters. Other services available include a Local cache, which could be User level, Application level, or Container level. Containers also can be configured to provide other services to Tasks running on them. For example, for MR tasks, the shuffle is now provided as a Node-level service. The ApplicationMaster  is now responsible for running jobs on the cluster. Based on their job(s) the clusters negotiate for Resources with the ResourceManager.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ApplicationMaster  itself runs on the cluster; at startup time a client submits an Application to the ResourceManager, which then allocates a container for the ApplicationMaster and launches it in that container. In the case of MR, the  ApplicationMaster takes over most of the tasks of the JobTracker: it launches Map and Reduce tasks, makes decisions on their placement, manages failover of tasks, maintains counters similar to Job state counters, and provides a monitoring inter-face for running Jobs.\n",

Each of these can expose its own programming model. ■Application Masters are free to negotiate resources in patterns that are opti- mized for their work: for example, machine learning Apps may hold Con-tainers for long durations.\n",
      "\n",
      "■The Resource and Container model allows nodes to be utilized in a dynamic manner, which increases the overall utilization of the cluster. ■The ResourceManager does only one thing—manage resources; hence it is highly scalable to tens of thousands of nodes. ■With ApplicationMasters managing Jobs, it is possible to have multiple ver- sions of an Application running on the cluster. There is no need for a global cluster update, which would require that all Jobs be stopped. Failure of an ApplicationMaster affects only Jobs managed by it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Resource- Manager provides some degree of management of ApplicationMasters. Let us briefly consider each of the components of the YARN environment. Resource Manager (RM). The Resource Manager is only concerned with allo- cating resources to Applications, and not with optimizing the processing within Applications. The policy of resource allocation is pluggable. Application Masters are supposed to request resources that would optimize their workload. The Resource Manager exposes the following interfaces: 1. An API for clients to start ApplicationMasters 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "A protocol for ApplicationMasters to negotiate for cluster resources 3. A protocol for NodeManagers to report on node resources and be managed by the Resource Manager The scheduler in the ResourceManager matches the Resource Requirements sub- mitted by Applications against the global state of the cluster resources. The alloca-tion is based on the policies of the pluggable Scheduler (such as capacity or fairness). Resources are requested by ApplicationMasters as Resource Requests .\n",
      "\n",
      "A Resource Request specifies: ■The number of containers needed ■The physical resources (CPU, memory) needed per container ■The locality preferences (physical node, rack) of the containers ■The priority of the request for the Application The scheduler satisfies these requests based on the state of the cluster as reported by the NodeManager heartbeats.\n",
      "\n",
      "The locality and priority guides the scheduler toward alternatives: for example, if a requested node is busy, the next best alternative is another node on the same rack.942 Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop The scheduler also has the ability to request resources back from an Application if needed and can even take back the resources forcibly. Applications, in returning a container, can migrate the work to another container, or checkpoint the state and restore it on another container.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to point out what the Resource man-ager is not responsible for: handling the execution of tasks within an application, providing any status information about applications, providing history of finished jobs, and providing any recovery for failed tasks. ApplicationMaster (AM). The ApplicationMaster is responsible for coordinating the execution of an Application on the cluster. An Application can be a set of pro-cesses like an MR Job, or it can be a long-running service like a Hadoop on demand (HOD) cluster serving multiple MR jobs. This is left to the Application Writer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ApplicationMaster will periodically notify the ResourceManager of its current Resource Requirements through a heartbeat mechanism. Resources are handed to the ApplicationMaster as Container leases. Resources used by an Application are dynamic: they are based on the progress of the application and the state of the clus-ter. Consider an example: the MR ApplicationMaster running an MR job will ask for a container on each of the m nodes where an InputSplit resides.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it gets a con- tainer on one of the nodes, the ApplicationMaster will either remove the request for containers on the rest of the m-1 nodes or at least reduce their priority. On the other hand, if the map task fails, it is AM that tracks this failure and requests con-tainers on other nodes that have a replica of the same InputSplit. NodeManager. A NodeManager runs on every worker node of the cluster. It manages Containers and provides pluggable services for Containers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on a detailed Container Launch Context  specification, a NodeManager can launch a pro- cess on its node with the environment and local directories set up. It also monitors to make sure the resource utilization does not exceed specifications. It also periodically reports on the state of the Containers and the node health. A NodeManager provides local services to all Containers running on it. The Log Aggregation  service is used to upload each task’s standard output and standard error (stdout and stderr) to HDFS.\n",
      "\n",
      "A NodeManager may be configured to run a set of pluggable auxillary services . For example, the MR Shuffle is provided as a NodeManager service. A Container run-ning a Map task produces the Map output and writes to local disk.The output is made available to Reducers of the Job via the Shuffle service running on the Node.

There is currently a push to provide an active/passive mode for RMs. The failure of an Application-Master is not a catastrophic event; it only affects one Application. It is responsible for recovering the state of its Application. For example, the MR ApplicationMaster will recover its completed task and rerun any running tasks. Failure of a Container because of issues with the Node or because of Application code is tracked by the framework and reported to the ApplicationMaster.\n",

      "\n",
      "25.5.3 Other Frameworks on YARN The YARN architecture described above has made it possible for other application frameworks to be developed as well as other programming models to be supported that can provide additional services on the shared Hadoop cluster. Here we list some of the Frameworks that have become available in YARN at the time this text was written. Apache Tez. Tez is an extensible framework being developed at Hortonworks for building high-performance applications in YARN; these applications will handle large datasets up to petabytes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tez allows users to express their workflow as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of tasks. Jobs are modeled as DAGs, where Vertices are tasks or operations and Edges represent interoperation dependencies or flows of data. Tez supports the standard dataflow patterns like pipeline, scatter-gather, and broadcast. Users can specify the concurrency in a DAG, as well as the failover characteristics, such as whether to store task output in persistent storage or to recompute it. The DAG can be changed at runtime based on job and cluster state.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DAG model is a more natural fit (than executing as one or more MapReduce jobs) for Pig scripts and SQL physical plans. Both Hive and Pig now provide a mode in which they run on Tez. Both have benefitted in terms of simpler plans and sig-nificant performance improvements. An often cited performance optimization is the Map-Reduce-Reduce pattern; an SQL query that has a Join followed by a Group-By normally is translated to two MR jobs: one for the Join and one for the Group-By.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first MR stage, the output of the join will be written to HDFS and read back in the Map phase of the second MR for the Group-By Job. In Tez, this extra write and read to/from HDFS can be avoided by having the Join Vertex of the DAG stream resulting rows to the Group-By Vertex. Apache Giraph. Apache Giraph is the open source implementation of Google’s Pregel system, 18 which was a large-scale graph processing system used to calculate Page-Rank.\n",
      "\n",
      "(See Section 27.7.3 for a definition of Page-Rank.) Pregel was based on the bulk synchronous processing (BSP) model of computation. 19 Giraph added sev- eral features to Pregel, including sharded aggregators (sharding, as defined in Chapter 24, refers to a form of partitioning) and edge-oriented input. The Hadoop v1 version of Giraph ran as MR jobs, which was not a very good fit. It did this by running long-running Map-only Jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "On YARN, the Giraph implementation exposes an iterative processing model. Giraph is currently used at Facebook to ana- lyze the social network users’ graph, which has users as nodes and their connections as edges; the current number of users is approximately 1.3 billion. Hoya: HBase on YARN. The Hortonworks Hoya (HBase on YARN) project pro- vides for elastic HBase clusters running on YARN with the goal of more flexibility and improved utilization of the cluster.\n",
      "\n",
      "We discussed HBase in Section 24.5 as a 18Pregel is described in Malewicz et al. (2010). 19BSP is a model for designing parallel algorithms and was originally proposed by Valiant (1990).944 Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop distributed, open source, nonrelational database that manages tables with billions of rows and millions of columns.\n",
      "\n",
      "HBase is patterned after BigTable from Google20 but is implemented using Hadoop and HDFS. Hoya is being developed to address the need for creating on-demand clusters of HBase, with possibly different versions of HBase running on the same cluster. Each of the HBase instances can be individually config-ured. The Hoya ApplicationMaster launches the HBase Master locally. The Hoya AM also asks the YARN RM for a set of containers to launch HBase RegionServers on the cluster.\n",
      "\n",
      "HBase RegionServers are the worker processes of Hbase; each ColumnFamily (which is like a set of Columns in a relational table) is distributed across a set of RegionServers. This can be used to start one or more HBase instances on the cluster, on demand. The clusters are elastic and can grow or shrink based on demand.\n",

Performance. In their paper, Pavlo et al. concluded that parallel DBMSs were three to six times faster than MR.\n",

      "The paper lists many reasons why the DBMSs gave better performance. Among the reasons given are the following: (i) indexing with B +-trees, which expedites selection and filtering; (ii) novel storage orientation (e.g., column-based storage has certain advantages); (iii) techniques that allow operations on compressed data directly; and (iv) parallel query optimization tech-niques common in parallel DBMSs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the time of Pavlo et al.’s comparison, which involved Hadoop version 0.19, huge strides have been made in the MR runtime, the storage formats, and the plan-ning capabilities for job scheduling and for optimizing complex data flows in the Hadoop ecosystem. ORC  and Parquet  file formats are sophisticated Columnar file formats that have the same aggressive compression techniques, the ability to push predicates to the storage layer, and the ability to answer aggregate queries without scanning data.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will briefly talk about the improvements in HDFS and MR; Apache Hive has made huge strides in both the runtime and Cost-based optimiza-tions of complex SQLs. In their move to transform Hadoop from batch into real-time and interactive query mode, Hortonworks (2014) reports orders-of-magnitude gains in performance of queries on a TPC-DS (decision support )–style bench-mark.\n",

PostgreSQL now supports key-value stores and json; most RDBMSs have a support for XML.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, one of the reasons for the performance gains on the Hadoop side has been the use of specialized data for- mats like ORC (Optimized Row Columnar) and Parquet (another open source columnar format).

It is not possible to address the details of cloud computing issues in the present context. However, we state some compelling reasons why big data technology is in some sense dependent on cloud technology not only for its further expansion, but for its continued existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "■The cloud model affords a high degree of flexibility in terms of management of resources: “scaling out,” which refers to adding more nodes or resources; “scaling up,” which refers to adding more resources to a node in the system; or even downgrading are easily handled almost instantaneously. ■The resources are interchangeable; this fact, coupled with the design of dis- tributed software, creates a good ecosystem where failure can be absorbed easily and where virtual computing instances can be left unperturbed.\n",

These projects are faced with the chal-lenge of providing for this peak demand on an as-needed and not necessar-ily continuous basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, business stakeholders expect swift, inexpensive, and dependable products and project outcomes. To meet with these conflicting requirements, cloud services offer an ideal solution. ■A common situation in which cloud services and big data go hand-in-hand is as follows: Data is transferred to or collected in a cloud data storage sys-tem, like Amazon’s S3, for the purpose of collecting log files or exporting text-formatted data. Alternatively, database adapters can be utilized to access data from databases in the cloud.\n",

      "Data processing frameworks like Pig, Hive, and MapReduce, which we described above in Section 25.4, are used to analyze raw data (which may have originated in the cloud). ■Big data projects and startup companies benefit a great deal from using a cloud storage service.

Netflix cites the main reason for its choice as the following: S3 is designed for 99.999999999% durability and 99.99% availability of objects over a given year, and S3 can sustain concurrent loss of data in two facilities. S3 provides bucket versioning, which allows Netflix to recover inadvertently deleted data.\n",

      "25.6.3  Data Locality Issues and Resource Optimization for Big Data Applications in a Cloud The increasing interest in cloud computing combined with the demands of big data technology means that data centers must be increasingly cost-effective and con- sumer-driven. Also, many cloud infrastructures are not intrinsically designed to handle the scale of data required for present-day data analytics. Cloud service pro- viders are faced with daunting challenges in terms of resource management and capacity planning to provide for big data technology applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "The network load of many big data applications, including Hadoop/MapReduce, is of special concern in a data center because large amounts of data can be generated dur-ing job execution. For instance, in a MapReduce job, each reduce task needs to read the output of all map tasks, and a sudden explosion of network traffic can signifi-cantly deteriorate cloud performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, when data is located in one infrastructure (say, in a storage cloud like Amazon S3) and processed in a compute cloud (such as Amazon EC2), job performance suffers significant delays due to data loading. Research projects have proposed 25 a self-configurable, locality-based data and vir- tual machine management framework based on the storage-compute model. This framework enables MapReduce jobs to access most of their data either locally or from close-by nodes, including all input, output, and intermediate data generated during map and reduce phases of the jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such frameworks categorize jobs using a data-size sensitive classifier into four classes based on a data size–based footprint. Then they provision virtual MapReduce clusters in a locality-aware manner, which enables efficient pairing and allocation of MapReduce virtual machines (VMs) to reduce the network distance between storage and compute nodes for both map and reduce processing. 25See Palanisamy et al. (2011).\n",

      "25.6 General Discussion  949 Recently, caching techniques have been shown to improve the performance of MapReduce jobs for various workloads.26 The PACMan framework provides sup- port for in-memory caching, and the MixApart system provides support for disk-based caching when the data is stored in an enterprise storage server within the same site. Caching techniques allow flexibility in that data is stored in a separate storage infrastructure that allows prefetching and caching of the most essential data.\n",

      "Recent work 27 has addressed the big data caching problem in the context of privacy-conscious scenarios, wherein data stored in encrypted form in a public cloud must be processed in a separate, secure enterprise site. In addition to the data locality problem, one of the most challenging goals for cloud providers is to optimally provision virtual clusters for jobs while minimizing the overall consumption cost of the cloud data center. An important focus of cloud resource optimization is to optimize globally across all jobs in the cloud as opposed to per-job resource optimizations.\n",

      "25.6.4 YARN as a Data Service Platform The separation of resource management from application management has taken Hadoop to another level as a platform. Hadoop v1 was all about MapReduce. In Hadoop v2, MapReduce is one of the many application frameworks that can run on the cluster. As we discussed in Section 25.5, this has opened the door for many services (with their own programming models) to be provided on YARN. There is no need to translate all data processing techniques and algorithms into a set of MapReduce jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "MapReduce is presently being used only for batch-oriented processing such as the ETL (extract, transform, load) process in data warehouses (see Chapter 29). The emerging trend is to see Hadoop as a data lake , where a significant portion of enter- prise data resides and where processing happens. Traditionally, HDFS has been where an enterprise’s historical data resides because HDFS can handle the scale of such data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most new sources of data, which in today’s search and social networking applications come from Web and machine logs, clickstream data, message data (as in Twitter) and sensor data, also is being stored largely in HDFS. 26See the PACMAN framework by Ananthanarayanan et al.

      "\n",
      "One alternative was to extract data from HDFS store to engines running outside the cluster in their own silos; such data was moved to graph engines, machine learning analytical applications, and so forth. The same machines as those used for the Hadoop cluster were being used for entirely different applications, such as stream processing outside of Hadoop. This scenario was far from ideal since phys-ical resources had to be divvied up in a static manner and it was difficult to migrate and upgrade to new versions when multiple frameworks ran on the same machines. With YARN, the above issues are addressed.\n",

      "Traditional services are taking advan-tage of the YARN ResourceManager and are providing their service on the same Hadoop cluster where the data resides. Whereas support for SQL in Hadoop was promised by multiple vendors, the actual support has been less than completely desirable. Some vendors required the HDFS data to be moved out to another database to run SQL; some required wrappers to read the HDFS data before an SQL query ran on it. A new trend among RDBMSs and traditional database systems considers a YARN cluster as a viable platform.\n",

These concerns include the following: ■Heterogeneity of information:  Heterogeneity in terms of data types, data formats, data representation, and semantics is unavoidable when it comes to sources of data. One of the phases in the big data life cycle involves integra-tion of this data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cost of doing a clean job of integration to bring all data into a single structure is prohibitive for most applications, such as health-care, energy, transportation, urban planning, and environmental modeling. Most machine learning algorithms expect data to be fed into them in a uni-form structure. The data provenance (which refers to the information about the origin and ownership of data) is typically not maintained in most analyt-ics applications. Proper interpretation of data analysis results requires large amounts of metadata.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Privacy and confidentiality:  Regulations and laws regarding protection of confidential information are not always available and hence not applied strictly during big data analysis. Enforcement of HIPAA regulations in the healthcare environment is one of few instances where privacy and confiden-tiality are strictly enforced. Location-based applications (such as on smart phones and other GPS-equipped devices), logs of user transactions, and clickstreams that capture user behavior all reveal confidential information.\n",

Data about customers, cardholders, and employees is held by organizations and thus is subject to breaches of confidentiality. Jag-adish et al.\n",

      "(2014) voiced a need for stricter control over digital rights man-agement of data similar to the control exercised in the music industry. ■Need for visualization and better human interfaces:  Huge volumes of data are crunched by big data systems, and the results of analyses must be inter- preted and understood by humans. Human preferences must be accounted for and data must be presented in a properly digestible form. Humans are experts at detecting patterns and have great intuition about data they are familiar with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Machines cannot match humans in this regard. It should be possible to bring together multiple human experts to share and interpret results of analysis and thereby increase understanding of those results. Mul-tiple modes of visual exploration must be possible to make the best use of data and to properly interpret results that are out of range and thus are clas-sified as outlier values. ■Inconsistent and incomplete information:  This has been a perennial prob- lem in data collection and management.\n",

A solu-tion may involve assembling ETL (extract, transform, load) processing, machine learning, graph processing, and/or report creation. Although these different func-tional engines all run on the same cluster, their programming models and metadata are not unified.

      "Rules that specify actions that are automatically triggered by certain events have been considered important enhancements to database systems for quite some time. In fact, the concept of triggers —a technique for specifying certain types of active rules—has existed in early versions of the SQL specification for relational databases, and triggers are now part of the SQL-99 and later standards. Commercial relational DBMSs—such as Oracle, DB2, and Microsoft SQLServer—have various versions of triggers available.\n",

In Section 26.1.1, we will present the general concepts that have been proposed for specifying rules for active databases. We will use the syntax of the Oracle commercial relational DBMS to illustrate these concepts with specific exam-ples, since Oracle triggers are close to the way rules are specified in the SQL stan-dard. Section 26.1.2 will discuss some general design and implementation issues for active databases.\n",

      "We give examples of how active databases are implemented in the STARBURST experimental DBMS in Section 26.1.3, since STARBURST provides for many of the concepts of generalized active databases within its framework. Sec-tion 26.1.4 discusses possible applications of active databases. Finally, Section 26.1.5 describes how triggers are declared in the SQL-99 standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "26.1.1  Generalized Model for Active Databases and Oracle Triggers The model that has been used to specify active database rules is referred to as the event-condition-action  (ECA)  model. A rule in the ECA model has three components: 1. The event(s)  that triggers the rule: These events are usually database update operations that are explicitly applied to the database. However, in the general model, they could also be temporal events 2 or other kinds of external events. 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "The condition  that determines whether the rule action should be executed: Once the triggering event has occurred, an optional  condition may be evalu- ated. If no condition  is specified, the action will be executed once the event 2An example would be a temporal event specified as a periodic time, such as: Trigger this rule every day at 5:30 a.m.964 Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models occurs. If a condition is specified, it is first evaluated, and only if it evaluates to true  will the rule action be executed.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The action  to be taken: The action is usually a sequence of SQL statements, but it could also be a database transaction or an external program that will be automatically executed. Let us consider some examples to illustrate these concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The examples are based on a much simplified variation of the COMPANY  database application from Figure 5.5 and are shown in Figure 26.1, with each employee having a name ( Name ), Social Security number ( Ssn), salary ( Salary ), department to which she is currently assigned ( Dno, a foreign key to DEPARTMENT ), and a direct supervisor ( Supervisor_ssn , a (recursive) foreign key to EMPLOYEE ).\n",
      "\n",
      "For this example, we assume that NULL  is allowed for Dno, indicating that an employee may be temporarily unassigned to any department. Each department has a name ( Dname ), number ( Dno), the total salary of all employees assigned to the department ( Total_sal ), and a manager ( Manager_ssn , which is a foreign key to EMPLOYEE ). Notice that the Total_sal  attribute is really a derived attribute whose value should be the sum of the salaries of all employees who are assigned to the particular depart-ment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maintaining the correct value of such a derived attribute can be done via an active rule. First we have to determine the events  that may cause  a change in the value of Total_sal , which are as follows: 1. Inserting (one or more) new employee tuples 2. Changing the salary of (one or more) existing employees 3. Changing the assignment of existing employees from one department to another 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deleting (one or more) employee tuples In the case of event 1, we only need to recompute Total_sal  if the new employee is immediately assigned to a department—that is, if the value of the Dno attribute for the new employee tuple is not NULL  (assuming NULL  is allowed for Dno). Hence, this would be the condition  to be checked. A similar condition could be checked for event 2 (and 4) to determine whether the employee whose salary is changed (or who is being deleted) is currently assigned to a department.\n",
      "\n",
      "For event 3, we will always execute an action to maintain the value of Total_sal  correctly, so no condition is needed (the action is always executed).Name Ssn Salary Dno Supervisor_ssnEMPLOYEE Dname Dno Total_sal Manager_ssnDEPARTMENTFigure 26.1 A simplified COMPANY database used for active rule examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "26.1 Active Database Concepts and Triggers  965 The action  for events 1, 2, and 4 is to automatically update the value of Total_sal  for the employee’s department to reflect the newly inserted, updated, or deleted employee’s salary. In the case of event 3, a twofold action is needed: one to update the Total_sal  of the employee’s old department and the other to update the Total_sal of the employee’s new department.\n",
      "\n",
      "The four active rules (or triggers) R1, R2, R3, and R4—corresponding to the above situation—can be specified in the notation of the Oracle DBMS as shown in Fig-ure 26.2(a). Let us consider rule R1 to illustrate the syntax of creating triggers in Oracle. The CREATE  TRIGGER  statement specifies a trigger (or active rule) name— Total_sal1  for R1. The AFTER  clause specifies that the rule will be triggered after  the events that trigger the rule occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "The triggering events—an insert of a new employee in this example—are specified following the AFTER  keyword.3 The ON clause specifies the relation on which the rule is specified— EMPLOYEE  for R1. The optional  keywords FOR EACH ROW  specify that the rule will be triggered once for each row  that is affected by the triggering event.4 The optional  WHEN  clause is used to specify any conditions that need to be checked after the rule is triggered, but before the action is executed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the action(s) to be taken is (are) specified as a PL/SQL block, which typically contains one or more SQL statements or calls to execute external procedures. The four triggers (active rules) R1, R2, R3, and R4 illustrate a number of features of active rules. First, the basic events  that can be specified for triggering the rules are the standard SQL update commands: INSERT , DELETE , and UPDATE . They are specified by the keywords INSERT , DELETE , and UPDATE  in Oracle notation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of UPDATE , one may specify the attributes to be updated—for example, by writing UPDATE OF Salary , Dno. Second, the rule designer needs to have a way to refer to the tuples that have been inserted, deleted, or modified by the triggering event. The keywords NEW  and OLD are used in Oracle notation; NEW  is used to refer to a newly inserted or newly updated tuple, whereas OLD is used to refer to a deleted tuple or to a tuple before it was updated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, rule R1 is triggered after an INSERT  operation is applied to the EMPLOYEE relation. In R1, the condition ( NEW .Dno IS NOT NULL ) is checked, and if it evaluates to true, meaning that the newly inserted employee tuple is related to a department, then the action is executed. The action updates the DEPARTMENT  tuple(s) related to the newly inserted employee by adding their salary ( NEW .Salary ) to the Total_sal attribute of their related department.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rule R2 is similar to R1, but it is triggered by an UPDATE  operation that updates the SALARY  of an employee rather than by an INSERT . Rule R3 is triggered by an update to the Dno attribute of EMPLOYEE , which signifies changing an employee’s assign- ment from one department to another. There is no condition to check in R3, so the 3As we will see, it is also possible to specify BEFORE instead of AFTER, which indicates that the rule is triggered before the triggering event is executed.\n",
      "\n",
      "4Again, we will see that an alternative is to trigger the rule only once  even if multiple rows (tuples) are affected by the triggering event.966 Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models (a) R1: CREATE TRIGGER  Total_sal1 AFTER INSERT ON  EMPLOYEE FOR EACH ROW WHEN  ( NEW .Dno IS NOT NULL  ) UPDATE  DEPARTMENT SET Total_sal = Total_sal + NEW .Salary WHERE  Dno = NEW .Dno; R2: CREATE TRIGGER  Total_sal2 AFTER UPDATE OF  Salary ON EMPLOYEE FOR EACH ROW WHEN  ( NEW .Dno IS NOT NULL  ) UPDATE  DEPARTMENT SET Total_sal = Total_sal + NEW .Salary – OLD.Salary WHERE  Dno = NEW .Dno; R3: CREATE TRIGGER  Total_sal3 AFTER UPDATE OF  Dno ON EMPLOYEE FOR EACH ROW BEGIN UPDATE  DEPARTMENT SET Total_sal = Total_sal + NEW .Salary WHERE  Dno = NEW .Dno; UPDATE  DEPARTMENT SET Total_sal = Total_sal – OLD.Salary WHERE  Dno = OLD.Dno; END ; R4: CREATE TRIGGER  Total_sal4 AFTER DELETE ON  EMPLOYEE FOR EACH ROW WHEN  ( OLD.Dno IS NOT NULL ) UPDATE  DEPARTMENT SET Total_sal = Total_sal – OLD.Salary WHERE  Dno = OLD.Dno; (b) R5: CREATE TRIGGER  Inform_supervisor1 BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OF  Salary, Supervisor_ssn ON EMPLOYEE FOR EACH ROW WHEN  ( NEW .Salary > ( SELECT  Salary FROM  EMPLOYEE WHERE  Ssn = NEW .Supervisor_ssn ) ) inform_supervisor( NEW .Supervisor_ssn, NEW .Ssn );Figure 26.2 Specifying active rules as triggers in Oracle notation.\n",

(b) Trigger for comparing an employee’s salary with that of his or her supervisor. 26.1 Active Database Concepts and Triggers  967 action is executed whenever the triggering event occurs. The action updates both the old department and new department of the reassigned employees by adding their salary to Total_sal  of their new department and subtracting their salary from Total_sal  of their old department.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that this should work even if the value of Dno is NULL , because in this case no department will be selected for the rule action.5 It is important to note the effect of the optional FOR EACH ROW  clause, which sig- nifies that the rule is triggered separately for each tuple. This is known as a row- level trigger . If this clause was left out, the trigger would be known as a statement-level trigger  and would be triggered once for each triggering statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "To see the difference, consider the following update operation, which gives a 10% raise to all employees assigned to department 5. This operation would be an event that triggers rule R2: UPDATE  EMPLOYEE SET Salary  = 1.1 * Salary WHERE  Dno  = 5; Because the above statement could update multiple records, a rule using row-level semantics, such as R2 in Figure 26.2, would be triggered once for each row , whereas a rule using statement-level semantics is triggered only once.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Oracle system allows the user to choose which of the above options is to be used for each rule. Including the optional FOR EACH ROW  clause creates a row-level trigger, and leav- ing it out creates a statement-level trigger. Note that the keywords NEW  and OLD can only be used with row-level triggers. As a second example, suppose we want to check whenever an employee’s salary is greater than the salary of his or her direct supervisor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several events can trigger this rule: inserting a new employee, changing an employee’s salary, or changing an employee’s supervisor. Suppose that the action to take would be to call an external procedure inform_supervisor ,6 which will notify the supervisor. The rule could then be written as in R5 (see Figure 26.2(b)). Figure 26.3 shows the syntax for specifying some of the main options available in Oracle triggers. We will describe the syntax for triggers in the SQL-99 standard in Section 26.1.5.\n",

A deactivated rule  will not be triggered by the triggering event. This feature allows users to selectively deactivate rules for cer-tain periods of time when they are not needed. The activate command  will make the rule active again. The drop command  deletes the rule from the sys- tem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another option is to group rules into named rule sets , so the whole set of rules can be activated, deactivated, or dropped. It is also useful to have a com-mand that can trigger a rule or rule set via an explicit PROCESS RULES  com- mand issued by the user. The second issue concerns whether the triggered action should be executed before, after, instead of , or concurrently with  the triggering event. A before trigger  exe- cutes the trigger before executing the event that caused the trigger.\n",

      "It can be used in applications such as checking for constraint violations. An after trigger  exe- cutes the trigger after executing the event, and it can be used in applications such as maintaining derived data and monitoring for specific events and conditions. An instead of trigger  executes the trigger instead of executing the event, and it can be used in applications such as executing corresponding updates on base relations in response to an event that is an update of a view. A related issue is whether the action being executed should be considered as a separate transaction  or whether it should be part of the same transaction that triggered the rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will try to categorize the various options. It is important to note that not all options may be available for a particular active database sys-tem. In fact, most commercial systems are limited to one or two of the options that we will now discuss. Let us assume that the triggering event occurs as part of a transaction execution. We should first consider the various options for how the triggering event is related to the evaluation of the rule’s condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rule condition evaluation  is also known as rule consideration , since the action is to be executed only after consid- ering whether the condition evaluates to true or false. There are three main possi-bilities for rule consideration: 26.1 Active Database Concepts and Triggers  969 1. Immediate consideration. The condition is evaluated as part of the same transaction as the triggering event and is evaluated immediately. This case can be further categorized into three options: /box4Evaluate the condition before  executing the triggering event.\n",
      "\n",
      "/box4Evaluate the condition after  executing the triggering event. /box4Evaluate the condition instead of  executing the triggering event. 2. Deferred consideration. The condition is evaluated at the end of the trans- action that included the triggering event. In this case, there could be many triggered rules waiting to have their conditions evaluated. 3. Detached consideration. The condition is evaluated as a separate transac- tion, spawned from the triggering transaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next set of options concerns the relationship between evaluating the rule condition and executing  the rule action. Here, again, three options are possible: immediate , deferred , or detached  execution. Most active systems use the first option. That is, as soon as the condition is evaluated, if it returns true, the action is immediately  executed. The Oracle system (see Section 26.1.1) uses the immediate consideration  model, but it allows the user to specify for each rule whether the before  or after  option is to be used with immediate condition evaluation.\n",

The STARBURST system (see Section 26.1.3) uses the deferred consider- ation  option, meaning that all rules triggered by a transaction wait until the trigger- ing transaction reaches its end and issues its COMMIT WORK  command before the rule conditions are evaluated.7 Another issue concerning active database rules is the distinction between row-level rules  and statement-level rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because SQL update statements (which act as trig- gering events) can specify a set of tuples, one must distinguish between whether the rule should be considered once for the whole statement  or whether it should be considered separately for each row  (that is, tuple) affected by the statement. The SQL-99 standard (see Section 26.1.5) and the Oracle system (see Section 26.1.1) allow the user to choose which of the options is to be used for each rule, whereas STARBURST uses statement-level semantics only.\n",

      "We will give examples of how statement-level triggers can be specified in Section 26.1.3. One of the difficulties that may have limited the widespread use of active rules, in spite of their potential to simplify database and software development, is that there are no easy-to-use techniques for designing, writing, and verifying rules. For exam-ple, it is difficult to verify that a set of rules is consistent , meaning that two or more rules in the set do not contradict one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also difficult to guarantee  termination  of a set of rules under all circumstances. To illustrate the termination problem briefly, consider the rules in Figure 26.4.

In this example, it is easy to see that these two rules can trigger one another indefinitely, leading to non-termination. However, if dozens of rules are written, it is very difficult to determine whether termination is guaranteed or not. If active rules are to reach their potential, it is necessary to develop tools for the design, debugging, and monitoring of active rules that can help users design and debug their rules.\n",

      "26.1.3  Examples of Statement-Level Active Rules in STARBURST We now give some examples to illustrate how rules can be specified in the STARBURST experimental DBMS.

      "\n",
      "The three active rules R1S, R2S, and R3S in Figure 26.5 correspond to the first three rules in Figure 26.2, but they use STARBURST notation and statement-level seman-tics. We can explain the rule structure using rule R1S. The CREATE RULE  statement specifies a rule name— Total_sal1  for R1S. The ON clause specifies the relation on which the rule is specified— EMPLOYEE  for R1S.\n",
      "\n",
      "The WHEN  clause is used to specify the events  that trigger the rule.8 The optional  IF clause is used to specify any conditions  that need to be checked. Finally, the THEN  clause is used to specify the actions  to be taken, which are typically one or more SQL statements. In STARBURST, the basic events that can be specified for triggering the rules are the standard SQL update commands: INSERT , DELETE , and UPDATE . These are specified by the keywords INSERTED , DELETED , and UPDATED  in STARBURST notation.\n",

Obviously, depending on the triggering events, only some of these transition tables may be available. The rule writer can refer to these tables when writing the condition and action parts of the rule. Transition tables contain tuples of the same type as those in the relation specified in the ON clause of the rule—for R1S, R2S, and R3S, this is the EMPLOYEE  relation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In statement-level semantics, the rule designer can only refer to the transition tables as a whole and the rule is triggered only once, so the rules must be written differ-ently than for row-level semantics. Because multiple employee tuples may be 972 Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models inserted in a single insert statement, we have to check if at least one  of the newly inserted employee tuples is related to a department.\n",
      "\n",
      "In R1S, the condition EXISTS  (SELECT  * FROM INSERTED WHERE  Dno IS NOT NULL  ) is checked, and if it evaluates to true, then the action is executed. The action updates in a single statement the DEPARTMENT  tuple(s) related to the newly inserted employee(s) by adding their salaries to the Total_sal  attribute of each related department. Because more than one newly inserted employee may belong to the same department, we use the SUM  aggregate function to ensure that all their salaries are added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rule R2S is similar to R1S, but is triggered by an UPDATE  operation that updates the salary of one or more employees rather than by an INSERT . Rule R3S is triggered by an update to the Dno attribute of EMPLOYEE , which signifies changing one or more employees’ assignment from one department to another.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no condi-tion in R3S, so the action is executed whenever the triggering event occurs.9 The action updates both the old department(s) and new department(s) of the reassigned employees by adding their salary to Total_sal  of each new department and subtract- ing their salary from Total_sal  of each old department. In our example, it is more complex to write the statement-level rules than the row- level rules, as can be illustrated by comparing Figures 26.2 and 26.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this is not a general rule, and other types of active rules may be easier to specify when using statement-level notation than when using row-level notation. The execution model for active rules in STARBURST uses deferred consideration . That is, all the rules that are triggered within a transaction are placed in a set—called the conflict set —which is not considered for evaluation of conditions and execution until the transaction ends (by issuing its COMMIT WORK  command).\n",
      "\n",
      "STARBURST also allows the user to explicitly start rule consideration in the middle of a transaction via an explicit PROCESS RULES  command. Because multiple rules must be evaluated, it is necessary to specify an order among the rules. The syntax for rule declaration in STARBURST allows the specification of ordering  among the rules to instruct the system about the order in which a set of rules should be consid-ered.\n",
      "\n",
      "10 Additionally, the transition tables— INSERTED , DELETED , NEW-UPDATED , and OLD-UPDATED —contain the net effect  of all the operations within the transac- tion that affected each table, since multiple operations may have been applied to each table during the transaction.\n",

      "26.1.4 Potential Applications for Active Databases We now briefly discuss some of the potential applications of active rules. Obvi-ously, one important application is to allow notification  of certain conditions that 9As in the Oracle examples, rules R1S and R2S can be written without a condition. However, it may be more efficient to execute them with the condition since the action is not invoked unless it is required. 10If no order is specified between a pair of rules, the system default order is based on placing the rule declared first ahead of the other rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "26.1 Active Database Concepts and Triggers  973 occur. For example, an active database may be used to monitor, say, the tempera- ture of an industrial furnace. The application can periodically insert in the database the temperature reading records directly from temperature sensors, and active rules can be written that are triggered whenever a temperature record is inserted, with a condition that checks if the temperature exceeds the danger level and results in the action to raise an alarm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Active rules can also be used to enforce integrity constraints  by specifying the types of events that may cause the constraints to be violated and then evaluating appropriate conditions that check whether the constraints are actually violated by the event or not. Hence, complex application constraints, often known as business rules , may be enforced that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in the UNIVERSITY  database applica- tion, one rule may monitor the GPA of students whenever a new grade is entered, and it may alert the advisor if the GPA of a student falls below a certain threshold; another rule may check that course prerequisites are satisfied before allowing a stu-dent to enroll in a course; and so on. Other applications include the automatic maintenance of derived data , such as the examples of rules R1 through R4 that maintain the derived attribute Total_sal  when- ever individual employee tuples are changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A similar application is to use active rules to maintain the consistency of materialized views  (see Section 5.3) whenever the base relations are modified. Alternately, an update operation specified on a view can be a triggering event, which can be converted to updates on the base relations by using an instead of  trigger. These applications are also relevant to the new data warehousing technologies (see Chapter 29). A related application maintains that replicated tables  are consistent by specifying rules that modify the replicas when- ever the master table is modified.\n",
      "\n",
      "26.1.5 Triggers in SQL-99 Triggers in the SQL-99 and later standards are similar to the examples we dis-cussed in Section 26.1.1, with some minor syntactic differences. The basic events that can be specified for triggering the rules are the standard SQL update com-mands: INSERT , DELETE , and UPDATE . In the case of UPDATE , one may specify the attributes to be updated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both row-level and statement-level triggers are allowed, indicated in the trigger by the clauses FOR EACH ROW  and FOR EACH  STATEMENT , respectively. One syntactic difference is that the trigger may specify particular tuple variable names for the old and new tuples instead of using the keywords NEW  and OLD , as shown in Figure 26.1. Trigger T1 in Figure 26.6 shows how the row-level trigger R2 from Figure 26.1(a) may be specified in SQL-99.\n",

Hence, they pro-vide a good example to illustrate the need for developing a set of unifying concepts for application developers to use. Temporal database applications have been devel-oped since the early days of database usage. However, in creating these applications, it is mainly left to the application designers and developers to discover, design, pro-gram, and implement the temporal concepts they need.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many examples of applications where some aspect of time is needed to maintain the information in a database. These include healthcare,  where patient histories need to be maintained; insurance,  where claims and accident histories are required as well as information about the times when insurance policies are in effect; reservation systems  in general (hotel, airline, car rental, train, and so on), where information on the dates and times when reservations are in effect are required; scientific databases,  where data collected from experiments includes the time when each data is measured; and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the two examples used in this book may be easily expanded into temporal applications. In the COMPANY  database, we may wish to keep SALARY , JOB, and PROJECT  histories on each employee. In the UNIVERSITY  database, time is already included in the SEMESTER  and YEAR  of each SECTION  of a COURSE , the grade his- tory of a STUDENT , and the information on research grants.\n",

Section 26.2.2 discusses how time can be incorporated into relational databases.\n",

      "Section 26.2.3 gives some additional options for representing time that are possible in database models that allow complex-structured objects, such as object databases. Section 26.2.4 introduces operations for querying temporal databases and gives a brief overview of the TSQL2 language, which extends SQL with temporal concepts. Section 26.2.5 focuses on time series data, which is a type of temporal data that is very important in practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "26.2.1  Time Representation, Calendars, and Time Dimensions For temporal databases, time is considered to be an ordered sequence  of points  in some granularity  that is determined by the application. For example, suppose that some temporal application never requires time units that are less than one second. Then, each time point represents one second using this granularity. In reality, each second is a (short) time duration,  not a point, since it may be further divided into milliseconds, microseconds, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Temporal database researchers have used the term chronon  instead of point  to describe this minimal granularity for a par- ticular application. The main consequence of choosing a minimum granularity—say, one second—is that events occurring within the same second will be considered to be simultaneous events,  even though in reality they may not be. Because there is no known beginning or ending of time, one needs a reference point from which to measure specific time points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Various calendars are used by various cultures (such as Gregorian (Western), Chinese, Islamic, Hindu, Jewish, Coptic, and so on) with different reference points. A calendar  organizes time into different time units for convenience. Most calendars group 60 seconds into a minute, 60 minutes into an hour, 24 hours into a day (based on the physical time of earth’s rotation around its axis), and 7 days into a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further groupings of days into months and months into years either follow solar or lunar natural phenomena and are generally irregular. In the Gregorian calendar, which is used in most Western countries, days are grouped into months that are 28, 29, 30, or 31 days, and 12 months are grouped into a year. Complex formulas are used to map the different time units to one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "In SQL2, the temporal data types (see Chapter 4) include DATE  (specifying Year, Month, and Day as YYYY-MM-DD), TIME  (specifying Hour, Minute, and Second as HH:MM:SS), TIMESTAMP  (specifying a Date/Time combination, with options for including subsecond divisions if they are needed), INTERVAL  (a relative time duration, such as 10 days or 250 minutes), and PERIOD  (an anchored  time duration with a fixed starting point, such as the 10-day period from January 1, 2009, to Jan-uary 10, 2009, inclusive).\n",

      "11 11Unfortunately, the terminology has not been used consistently. For example, the term interval  is often used to denote an anchored duration. For consistency, we will use the SQL terminology.976 Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models Event Information versus Duration (or State) Information. A temporal data- base will store information concerning when certain events occur, or when certain facts are considered to be true. There are several different types of temporal infor-mation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Point events  or facts  are typically associated in the database with a single time point  in some granularity. For example, a bank deposit event may be associ- ated with the timestamp when the deposit was made, or the total monthly sales of a product (fact) may be associated with a particular month (say, February 2010). Note that even though such events or facts may have different granularities, each is still associated with a single time value  in the database.\n",

      "This type of information is often represented as time series data , as we will discuss in Section 26.2.5. Duration events  or facts , on the other hand, are associated with a specific time period  in the database. 12 For example, an employee may have worked in a company from Aug- ust 15, 2003 until November 20, 2008. A time period  is represented by its start  and end time points  [START-TIME , ENDTIME] .\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the above period is represented as [2003-08-15, 2008-11- 20]. Such a time period is often interpreted to mean the set of all time points  from start- time to end-time, inclusive, in the specified granularity.\n",

      "Hence, assuming day gran-ularity, the period [2003-08-15, 2008-11-20] represents the set of all days from August 15, 2003, until November 20, 2008, inclusive. 13 Valid Time and Transaction Time Dimensions. Given a particular event or fact that is associated with a particular time point or time period in the database, the association may be interpreted to mean different things.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most natural interpre-tation is that the associated time is the time that the event occurred, or the period during which the fact was considered to be true in the real world. If this interpreta- tion is used, the associated time is often referred to as the valid time . A temporal database using this interpretation is called a valid time database . However, a different interpretation can be used, where the associated time refers to the time when the information was actually stored in the database; that is, it is the value of the system time clock when the information is valid in the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "14 In this case, the associated time is called the transaction time . A temporal database using this interpretation is called a transaction time database . Other interpretations can also be intended, but these are considered to be the most common ones, and they are referred to as time dimensions . In some applications, only one of the dimensions is needed and in other cases both time dimensions are required, in which case the temporal database is called a bitemporal database . If 12This is the same as an anchored duration .\n",

      "It has also been frequently called a time interval , but to avoid confusion we will use period  to be consistent with SQL terminology. 13The representation [2003-08-15, 2008-11-20] is called a closed interval  representation. One can also use an open interval , denoted [2003-08-15, 2008-11-21), where the set of points does not include the end point.\n",

Hence, the constraint that any two tuple versions representing the same entity should have nonintersecting valid time periods should hold on valid time relations.\n",

Hence, if all real-world changes are applied, the database keeps a history of the real-world states  that are represented.\n",

This allows the database administrator to have different access paths, such as indexes for each relation, and keeps the size of the current table reasonable. Another possibility is to create a third table for corrected tuples whose Tet is not uc.\n",

      "Another option that is available is to vertically partition  the attributes of the temporal relation into separate relations so that if a relation has many attributes, a whole new tuple version is created whenever any one of the attributes is updated. If the attributes are updated asynchronously, each new version may differ in only one of the attri- butes, thus needlessly repeating the other attribute values. If a separate relation is cre- ated to contain only the attributes that always change synchronously,  with the primary key replicated in each relation, the database is said to be in temporal normal form .\n",
      "\n",
      "However, to combine the information, a variation of join known as temporal intersection join  would be needed, which is generally expensive to implement. It is important to note that bitemporal databases allow a complete record of changes. Even a record of corrections is possible. For example, it is possible that two tuple versions of the same employee may have the same valid time but different attribute values as long as their transaction times are disjoint. In this case, the tuple with the later transaction time is a correction  of the other tuple version. Even incorrectly entered valid times may be corrected this way.\n",

      "26.2.3  Incorporating Time in Object-Oriented Databases Using Attribute Versioning The previous section discussed the tuple versioning approach  to implementing temporal databases. In this approach, whenever one attribute value is changed, a whole new tuple version is created, even though all the other attribute values will  26.2 Temporal Database Concepts  983 be identical to the previous tuple version. An alternative approach can be used in database systems that support complex structured objects , such as object databases (see Chapter 11) or object-relational systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach is called attribute versioning . In attribute versioning, a single complex object is used to store all the temporal changes of the object. Each attribute that changes over time is called a time- varying attribute , and it has its values versioned over time by adding temporal periods to the attribute. The temporal periods may represent valid time, transac-tion time, or bitemporal, depending on the application requirements. Attributes that do not change over time are called non-time-varying  and are not associated with the temporal periods.\n",
      "\n",
      "To illustrate this, consider the example in Fig-ure 26.10, which is an attribute-versioned valid time representation of EMPLOYEE class TEMPORAL_SALARY { attribute Date Valid_start_time; attribute Date Valid_end_time; attribute float Salary; }; class TEMPORAL_DEPT { attribute Date Valid_start_time; attribute Date Valid_end_time; attribute DEPARTMENT_VT Dept; }; class TEMPORAL_SUPERVISOR { attribute Date Valid_start_time; attribute Date Valid_end_time; attribute EMPLOYEE_VT Supervisor; }; class TEMPORAL_LIFESPAN { attribute Date Valid_ start time; attribute Date Valid end time; }; class EMPLOYEE_VT ( extent EMPLOYEES ){ attribute list<TEMPORAL_LIFESPAN> lifespan; attribute string  Name; attribute string  Ssn; attribute list<TEMPORAL_SALARY> Sal_history; attribute list<TEMPORAL_DEPT> Dept_history; attribute list <TEMPORAL_SUPERVISOR> Supervisor_history; };Figure 26.10 Possible ODL schema for a temporal valid time EMPLOYEE_VT object class using  attribute versioning.984 Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models using the object definition language (ODL) notation for object databases (see Chapter 11).\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, we assumed that name and Social Security number are non-time-varying attributes, whereas salary, department, and supervisor are time-varying attributes (they may change over time). Each time-varying attribute is represented as a list of tuples <Valid_start_time , Valid_end_time , Value> , ordered by valid start time. Whenever an attribute is changed in this model, the current attribute version is closed  and a new attribute version  for this attribute only is appended to the list. This allows attributes to change asynchronously.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current value for each attri-bute has now for its Valid_end_time . When using attribute versioning, it is useful to include a lifespan temporal attribute  associated with the whole object whose value is one or more valid time periods that indicate the valid time of existence for the whole object. Logical deletion of the object is implemented by closing the lifespan. The constraint that any time period of an attribute within an object should be a subset of the object’s lifespan should be enforced.\n",
      "\n",
      "For bitemporal databases, each attribute version would have a tuple with five components: < Valid_start_time , Valid_end_time , Trans_start_time , Trans_end_time , Value > The object lifespan would also include both valid and transaction time dimensions. Therefore, the full capabilities of bitemporal databases can be available with attri-bute versioning. Mechanisms similar to those discussed earlier for updating tuple versions can be applied to updating attribute versions.\n",

Now we give a brief overview of how query operations need to be extended for temporal querying.

      "\n",
      "In nontemporal relational databases, the typical selection conditions involve attri- bute conditions, and tuples that satisfy these conditions are selected from the set of current tuples. Following that, the attributes of interest to the query are specified by a projection operation  (see Chapter 6).\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in the query to retrieve the names of all employees working in department 5 whose salary is greater than 30000, the selection condition would be as follows: ((Salary > 30000) AND  (Dno  = 5)) The projected attribute would be Name . In a temporal database, the conditions may involve time in addition to attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "A pure time condition  involves only time—for example, to select all employee tuple versions that were valid on a cer-tain time point T  or that were valid during a certain time period [T1, T2]. In this  26.2 Temporal Database Concepts  985 case, the specified time period is compared with the valid time period of each tuple version [T.Vst, T.Vet], and only those tuples that satisfy the condition are selected.\n",
      "\n",
      "In these operations, a period is considered to be equivalent to the set of time points from T 1 to T2 inclusive, so the standard set comparison operations can be used.\n",

      "Additional operations, such as whether one time period ends before  another starts, are also needed.21 Some of the more common operations used in queries are as follows: [T.Vst, T.Vet] INCLUDES  [T1, T2] Equivalent to T1 ≥ T.Vst AND  T2 ≤ T.Vet [T.Vst, T.Vet] INCLUDED_IN  [T1, T2] Equivalent to T1 ≤ T.Vst AND  T2 ≥ T.Vet [T.Vst, T.Vet] OVERLAPS  [T1, T2] Equivalent to ( T1 ≤ T.Vet AND  T2 ≥ T.Vst)22 [T.Vst, T.Vet] BEFORE  [T1, T2] Equivalent to T1 ≥ T.Vet [T.Vst, T.Vet] AFTER  [T1, T2] Equivalent to T2 ≤ T.Vst [T.Vst, T.Vet] MEETS_BEFORE  [T1, T2] Equivalent to T1 = T.Vet + 123 [T.Vst, T.Vet] MEETS_AFTER  [T1, T2] Equivalent to T2 + 1 = T.Vst Additionally, operations are needed to manipulate time periods, such as computing the union or intersection of two time periods.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results of these operations may not themselves be periods, but rather temporal elements —a collection of one or more disjoint  time periods such that no two time periods in a temporal element are directly adjacent. That is, for any two time periods [T1, T2] and [T3, T4] in a tempo- ral element, the following three conditions must hold: ■[T1, T2] intersection [ T3, T4] is empty. ■T3 is not the time point following T2 in the given granularity.\n",
      "\n",
      "■T1 is not the time point following T4 in the given granularity. The latter conditions are necessary to ensure unique representations of temporal elements. If two time periods [T1, T2] and [T3, T4] are adjacent, they are combined into a single time period [T1, T4]. This is called coalescing  of time periods. Coalesc- ing also combines intersecting time periods.\n",

      "\n",
      "In TSQL2, rather than have the user actually see how the temporal tables are implemented (as we discussed in the previous sections), the TSQL2 language adds query language constructs to specify various types of temporal selections, temporal projections, temporal aggregations, transformation among granularities, and many other concepts.

They involve data values that are recorded according to a specific predefined sequence of time points. Therefore, they are a special type of valid event data , where the event’s time points are predetermined according to a fixed calendar. Consider the example of closing daily stock prices of a particular company on the New York Stock Exchange. The granularity here is day, but the days that the stock market is open are known (non-holiday weekdays).\n",

As another example, consider the daily sales dollar amount at each store of a chain of stores owned by a particular company.\n",

For example, suppose that a map contains features that represent counties within a U.S. state (such as Texas or Oregon).\n",

      "26.3.3 Spatial Operators and Spatial Queries Spatial operators are used to capture all the relevant geometric properties of objects embedded in the physical space and the relations between them, as well as to per-form spatial analysis. Operators are classified into three broad categories. ■Topological operators. Topological properties are invariant when topo- logical transformations are applied. These properties do not change after transformations like rotation, translation, or scaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Topological operators are hierarchically structured in several levels, where the base level offers operators the ability to check for detailed topological relations between regions with a broad boundary, and the higher levels offer more abstract operators that allow users to query uncertain spatial data independent of the underlying geometric data model. Examples include open (region), close (region), and inside (point, loop). ■Projective operators.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projective operators, such as convex hull , are used to express predicates about the concavity/convexity of objects as well as other spatial relations (for example, being inside the concavity of a given object). ■Metric operators. Metric operators provide a more specific description of the object’s geometry. They are used to measure some global properties of single objects (such as the area, relative size of an object’s parts, compact-ness, and symmetry), and to measure the relative position of different objects in terms of distance and direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples include length (arc) and dis-tance (point, point). Dynamic Spatial Operators. The operations performed by the operators men- tioned above are static, in the sense that the operands are not affected by the appli-cation of the operation. For example, calculating the length of the curve has no effect on the curve itself. Dynamic operations  alter the objects upon which the operations act. The three fundamental dynamic operations are create , destroy , and  26.3 Spatial Database Concepts  991 update.\n",
      "\n",
      "A representative example of dynamic operations would be updating a spa- tial object that can be subdivided into translate (shift position), rotate (change ori-entation), scale up or down, reflect (produce a mirror image), and shear (deform). Spatial Queries. Spatial queries are requests for spatial data that require the use of spatial operations. The following categories illustrate three typical types of spatial queries: ■Range queries. Find all objects of a particular type that are within a given spatial area; for example, find all hospitals within the Metropolitan Atlanta city area.\n",
      "\n",
      "A variation of this query is to find all objects within a particular distance from a given location; for example, find all ambulances within a five mile radius of an accident location. ■Nearest neighbor queries. Finds an object of a particular type that is closest to a given location; for example, find the police car that is closest to the loca-tion of a crime. This can be generalized to find the k nearest neighbors, such as the 5 closest ambulances to an accident location. ■Spatial joins or overlays.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typically joins the objects of two types based on some spatial condition, such as the objects intersecting or overlapping spa- tially or being within a certain distance of one another. For example, find all townships located on a major highway between two cities or find all homes that are within two miles of a lake. The first example spatially joins township objects and highway  object, and the second example spatially joins lake objects and home  objects.\n",

The bucket regions are usually rectangles; for point data struc-tures, these regions are disjoint and they partition the space so that each point belongs to precisely one bucket.

The algorithms for converting from 2-D to 1-D are known as space filling curves . We will not discuss these methods in detail (see the Selected Bibliography for further references). We give an overview of some of the spatial indexing techniques next.992 Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models Grid Files.\n",
      "\n",
      "We introduced grid files for indexing of data on multiple attributes in Chapter 18. They can also be used for indexing two-dimensional and higher n-dimensional spatial data. The fixed-grid  method divides an n-dimensional hyperspace into equal size buckets. The data structure that implements the fixed grid is an n-dimensional array. The objects whose spatial locations lie within a cell (totally or partially) can be stored in a dynamic structure to handle overflows. This structure is useful for uniformly distributed data like satellite imagery.\n",

      "However, the fixed-grid structure is rigid, and its directory can be sparse and large. R-Trees. The R-tree  is a height-balanced tree, which is an extension of the B +-tree for k-dimensions, where k > 1. For two dimensions (2-D), spatial objects are approximated in the R-tree by their minimum bounding rectangle  (MBR ), which is the smallest rectangle, with sides parallel to the coordinate system ( x and y) axis, that contains the object.\n",
      "\n",
      "R-trees are characterized by the following properties, which are similar to the properties for B+-trees (see Section 18.3) but are adapted to 2-D spatial objects. As in Section 18.3, we use M to indicate the maximum number of entries that can fit in an R-tree node. 1. The structure of each index entry (or index record) in a leaf node is (I, object- identifier ), where I is the MBR for the spatial object whose identifier is object-identifier . 2.\n",

      "Every node except the root node must be at least half full. Thus, a leaf node that is not the root should contain m entries (I, object-identifier ) where M/2 ≤ m ≤ M.

      "\n",
      "All leaf nodes are at the same level, and the root node should have at least two pointers unless it is a leaf node. 4. All MBRs have their sides parallel to the axes of the global coordinate system. Other spatial storage structures include quadtrees and their variations. Quadtrees generally divide each space or subspace into equally sized areas and proceed with the subdivisions of each subspace to identify the positions of various objects. Recently, many newer spatial access structures have been proposed, and this remains an active research area. Spatial Join Index.\n",
      "\n",
      "A spatial join index precomputes a spatial join operation and stores the pointers to the related object in an index structure. Join indexes improve the performance of recurring join queries over tables that have low update rates. Spatial join conditions are used to answer queries such as “Create a list of highway-river combinations that cross.” The spatial join is used to identify and retrieve these pairs of objects that satisfy the cross  spatial relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because computing the results of spatial relationships is generally time consum-ing, the result can be computed once and stored in a table that has the pairs of object identifiers (or tuple ids) that satisfy the spatial relationship, which is essen-tially the join index.\n",

      "26.3 Spatial Database Concepts  993 A join index can be described by a bipartite graph G = (V1, V2, E), where V1 contains the tuple ids of relation R and V2 contains the tuple ids of relation S. Edge set con- tains an edge ( vr, vs) for vr in R and vs in S, if there is a tuple corresponding to ( vr , vs) in the join index. The bipartite graph models all of the related tuples as connected vertices in the graphs.\n",

For example, people with similar charac-teristics, occupations, and backgrounds tend to cluster together in the same neigh-borhoods. The three major spatial data mining techniques are spatial classification, spatial association, and spatial clustering. ■Spatial classification. The goal of classification is to estimate the value of an attribute of a relation based on the value of the relation’s other attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "An example of the spatial classification problem is determining the locations of nests in a wetland based on the value of other attributes (for example, vege-tation durability and water depth); it is also called the location prediction problem . Similarly, where to expect hotspots in crime activity is also a loca- tion prediction problem. ■Spatial association. Spatial association rules  are defined in terms of spatial predicates rather than items.\n",
      "\n",
      "A spatial association rule is of the form P1 ∧ P2 ∧ … ∧ Pn ⇒ Q1 ∧ Q2 ∧ … ∧ Qm where at least one of the P i’s or Q j’s is a spatial predicate.\n",

      "For example, the rule is_a( x, country) ∧ touches( x, Mediterranean) ⇒ is_a ( x, wine-exporter) (that is, a country that is adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea is typically a wine exporter) is an example of an association rule, which will have a certain sup-port s and confidence c. 27 Spatial colocation rules  attempt to generalize association rules to point to collec- tion data sets that are indexed by space.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several crucial differences between spatial and nonspatial associations, including the following: 1. The notion of a transaction is absent in spatial situations, since data is embedded in continuous space. Partitioning space into transactions would lead to an overestimate or an underestimate of interest measures, for exam-ple, support or confidence. 2. Size of item sets in spatial databases is small, that is, there are many fewer items in the item set in a spatial situation than in a nonspatial situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "27Concepts of support and confidence for association rules are discussed as part of data mining in Section 28.2.994 Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models In most instances, spatial items are a discrete version of continuous variables. For example, in the United States income regions may be defined as regions where the mean yearly income is within certain ranges, such as, below $40,000, from $40,000 to $100,000, and above $100,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Spatial clustering  attempts to group database objects so that the most similar objects are in the same cluster, and objects in different clusters are as dissimi-lar as possible. One application of spatial clustering is to group together seis-mic events in order to determine earthquake faults. An example of a spatial clustering algorithm is density-based clustering , which tries to find clusters based on the density of data points in a region. These algorithms treat clus-ters as dense regions of objects in the data space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two variations of these algorithms are density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) 28 and density-based clustering (DENCLUE).29 DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm because it finds a number of clusters starting from the estimated density distribution of corresponding nodes.\n",

Spatial database man-agement is playing an important role in the solution of challenging scientific prob-lems such as global climate change and genomics. Due to the spatial nature of genome data, GIS and spatial database management systems have a large role to play in the area of bioinformatics.\n",

      "Some of the typical applications include pattern recognition (for example, to check if the topology of a particular gene in the genome is found in any other sequence feature map in the database), genome browser devel-opment, and visualization maps. Another important application area of spatial data mining is the spatial outlier detection. A spatial outlier  is a spatially referenced object whose nonspatial attribute values are significantly different from those of other spatially referenced objects in its spatial neighborhood.\n",

The main types of database queries that are needed involve locating mul-timedia sources that contain certain objects of interest. For example, one may want to locate all video clips in a video database that include a certain person, say Michael Jackson. One may also want to retrieve video clips based on certain activ-ities included in them, such as video clips where a soccer goal is scored by a certain player or team.\n",
      "\n",
      "The above types of queries are referred to as content-based retrieval , because the multimedia source is being retrieved based on its containing certain objects or activities. Hence, a multimedia database must use some model to organize and index the multimedia sources based on their contents. Identifying the contents  of multimedia sources is a difficult and time-consuming task. There are two main approaches. The first is based on automatic analysis  of the multimedia sources to identify certain mathematical characteristics of their contents. This approach uses different techniques depending on the type of multimedia source (image, video, audio, or text).\n",
      "\n",
      "The second approach depends on manual identification  of the objects and activities of interest in each multimedia source and on using this infor-mation to index the sources. This approach can be applied to all multimedia sources, but it requires a manual preprocessing phase in which a person must scan each multimedia source to identify and catalog the objects and activities it contains so that they can be used to index the sources. In the first part of this section, we will briefly discuss some of the characteristics of each type of multimedia source—images, video, audio, and text/documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we will discuss approaches for automatic analysis of images followed by the prob-lem of object recognition in images. We end this section with some remarks on analyzing audio sources. An image  is typically stored either in raw form as a set of pixel or cell values, or in compressed form to save space. The image shape descriptor  describes the geo- metric shape of the raw image, which is typically a rectangle of cells  of a certain width and height. Hence, each image can be represented by an m by n grid of cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each cell contains a pixel value that describes the cell content. In black-and-white images, pixels can be one bit. In grayscale or color images, a pixel is multiple bits. Because images may require large amounts of space, they are often stored in compressed form. Compression standards, such as GIF, JPEG, or MPEG, use various mathematical transformations to reduce the number of cells stored but still maintain the main image characteristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Applicable mathemati-cal transforms include discrete Fourier transform (DFT), discrete cosine trans-form (DCT), and wavelet transforms. To identify objects of interest in an image, the image is typically divided into homogeneous segments using a homogeneity predicate. For example, in a color image, adjacent cells that have similar pixel values are grouped into a segment. The homogeneity predicate defines conditions for automatically grouping those cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segmentation and compression can hence identify the main characteristics of an image.996 Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models A typical image database query would be to find images in the database that are similar to a given image. The given image could be an isolated segment that con-tains, say, a pattern of interest, and the query is to locate other images that contain that same pattern. There are two main techniques for this type of search. The first approach uses a distance function  to compare the given image with the stored images and their segments.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the distance value returned is small, the probability of a match is high. Indexes can be created to group stored images that are close in the distance metric so as to limit the search space. The second approach, called the transformation approach , measures image similarity by having a small number of transformations that can change one image’s cells to match the other image. Trans-formations include rotations, translations, and scaling. Although the transforma-tion approach is more general, it is also more time-consuming and difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "A video source  is typically represented as a sequence of frames, where each frame is a still image. However, rather than identifying the objects and activities in every individual frame, the video is divided into video segments , where each segment comprises a sequence of contiguous frames that includes the same objects/activi-ties. Each segment is identified by its starting and ending frames. The objects and activities identified in each video segment can be used to index the segments. An indexing technique called frame segment trees  has been proposed for video index- ing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The index includes both objects, such as persons, houses, and cars, as well as activities, such as a person delivering  a speech or two people talking . Videos are also often compressed using standards such as MPEG. Audio sources  include stored recorded messages, such as speeches, class presenta- tions, or even surveillance recordings of phone messages or conversations by law enforcement. Here, discrete transforms can be used to identify the main character-istics of a certain person’s voice in order to have similarity-based indexing and retrieval.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will briefly comment on their analysis in Section 26.4.4. A text/document source  is basically the full text of some article, book, or magazine. These sources are typically indexed by identifying the keywords that appear in the text and their relative frequencies. However, filler words or common words called stopwords  are eliminated from the process. Because there can be many keywords when attempting to index a collection of documents, techniques have been devel-oped to reduce the number of keywords to those that are most relevant to the col-lection.\n",
      "\n",
      "A dimensionality reduction technique called singular value decomposition (SVD), which is based on matrix transformations, can be used for this purpose. An indexing technique called telescoping vector trees  (TV-trees) can then be used to group similar documents. Chapter 27 discusses document processing in detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "26.4.1 Automatic Analysis of Images Analysis of multimedia sources is critical to support any type of query or search interface. We need to represent multimedia source data such as images in terms of features that would enable us to define similarity. The work done so far in this area uses low-level visual features such as color, texture, and shape, which are directly  26.4 Multimedia Database Concepts  997 related to the perceptual aspects of image content.\n",
      "\n",
      "These features are easy to extract and represent, and it is convenient to design similarity measures based on their statistical properties. Color  is one of the most widely used visual features in content-based image retrieval since it does not depend upon image size or orientation. Retrieval based on color similarity is mainly done by computing a color histogram for each image that iden-tifies the proportion of pixels within an image for the three color channels (red, green, blue— RGB ). However, RGB representation is affected by the orientation of the object with respect to illumination and camera direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, current image retrieval techniques compute color histograms using competing invariant representations such as HSV  (hue, saturation, value). HSV describes colors as points in a cylinder whose central axis ranges from black at the bottom to white at the top with neutral colors between them. The angle around the axis corresponds to the hue, the distance from the axis corresponds to the saturation, and the distance along the axis corresponds to the value (brightness).\n",
      "\n",
      "Texture  refers to the patterns in an image that present the properties of homogene- ity that do not result from the presence of a single color or intensity value. Examples of texture classes are rough and silky. Examples of textures that can be identified include pressed calf leather, straw matting, cotton canvas, and so on. Just as pictures are represented by arrays of pixels (picture elements), textures are represented by arrays of texels  (texture elements).\n",
      "\n",
      "These textures are then placed into a number of sets, depending on how many textures are identified in the image. These sets not only contain the texture definition but also indicate where in the image the texture is located. Texture identification is primarily done by modeling it as a two-dimensional, gray-level variation. The relative brightness of pairs of pixels is computed to estimate the degree of contrast, regularity, coarseness, and directionality. Shape  refers to the shape of a region within an image. It is generally determined by applying segmentation or edge detection to an image.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segmentation  is a region- based approach that uses an entire region (sets of pixels), whereas edge detection  is a boundary-based approach that uses only the outer boundary characteristics of entities. Shape representation is typically required to be invariant to translation, rotation, and scaling. Some well-known methods for shape representation include Fourier descriptors and moment invariants.\n",

      "26.4.2 Object Recognition in Images Object recognition  is the task of identifying real-world objects in an image or a video sequence. The system must be able to identify the object even when the images of the object vary in viewpoints, size, scale, or even when they are rotated or translated. Some approaches have been developed to divide the original image into regions based on similarity of contiguous pixels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, in a given image showing a tiger in the jungle, a tiger subimage may be detected against the back-ground of the jungle, and when compared with a set of training images, it may be tagged as a tiger.998 Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models The representation of the multimedia object in an object model is extremely impor- tant. One approach is to divide the image into homogeneous segments using a homogeneous predicate. For example, in a colored image, adjacent cells that have similar pixel values are grouped into a segment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The homogeneity predicate defines conditions for automatically grouping those cells. Segmentation and compression can hence identify the main characteristics of an image. Another approach finds measurements of the object that are invariant to transformations. It is impossible to keep a database of examples of all the different transformations of an image. To deal with this, object recognition approaches find interesting points (or features) in an image that are invariant to transformations. An important contribution to this field was made by Lowe, 30 who used scale-invari- ant features from images to perform reliable object recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach is called scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) . The SIFT features are invariant to image scaling and rotation, and partially invariant to change in illumination and 3D camera viewpoint. They are well localized in both the spatial and frequency domains, reducing the probability of disruption by occlusion, clutter, or noise. In addition, the features are highly distinctive, which allows a single feature to be cor-rectly matched with high probability against a large database of features, providing a basis for object and scene recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "For image matching and recognition, SIFT features (also known as keypoint fea- tures ) are first extracted from a set of reference images and stored in a database. Object recognition is then performed by comparing each feature from the new image with the features stored in the database and finding candidate matching fea-tures based on the Euclidean distance of their feature vectors. Since the keypoint features are highly distinctive, a single feature can be correctly matched with good probability in a large database of features.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to SIFT, there are a number of competing methods available for object recognition under clutter or partial occlusion. For example, RIFT , a rotation invari- ant generalization of SIFT, identifies groups of local affine regions (image features having a characteristic appearance and elliptical shape) that remain approximately affinely rigid across a range of views of an object, and across multiple instances of the same object class.\n",

      "26.4.3 Semantic Tagging of Images The notion of implicit tagging is an important one for image recognition and com-parison. Multiple tags may attach to an image or a subimage: for instance, in the example we referred to above, tags such as “tiger,” “jungle,” “green,” and “stripes” may be associated with that image. Most image search techniques retrieve images based on user-supplied tags that are often not very accurate or comprehensive.\n",

To solve this problem, recent research techniques have proposed the use of concept hierar-chies, taxonomies, or ontologies using OWL (Web Ontology Language) , in which terms and their relationships are clearly defined. These can be used to infer higher-level concepts based on tags.\n",

Each of these is significantly different from the others; hence different types of audio data are treated differently. Audio data must be digitized before it can be processed and stored.

      "Clarity of sound recordings is easy to perceive humanly but is hard to quantify for machine learning. Interestingly, speech data often uses speech recognition techniques to aid the actual audio content, as this can make indexing this data a lot easier and more accurate.

The speech metadata is typically content dependent, in that the metadata is generated from the audio content; for example, the length of the speech, the number of speakers, and so on.\n",

      "However, some of the metadata might be independent of the actual content, such as the length of the speech and the format in which the data is stored. Music indexing, on the other hand, is done based on the statistical analysis of the audio signal, also known as content-based indexing . Content-based indexing often makes use of the key features of sound: intensity, pitch, timbre, and rhythm. It is possible to compare different pieces of audio data and retrieve information from them based on the calculation of certain features, as well as application of certain transforms.\n",

The model used for deductive databases is closely related to the relational data model, and particularly to the domain relational calculus formalism (see Section 6.6).\n",

      "A deductive database uses two main types of specifications: facts and rules. Facts are specified in a manner similar to the way relations are specified, except that it is not necessary to include the attribute names. Recall that a tuple in a relation describes some real-world fact whose meaning is partly determined by the attribute names. In a deductive database, the meaning of an attribute value in a tuple is deter-mined solely by its position  within the tuple. Rules  are somewhat similar to rela- tional views.\n",

      "They specify virtual relations that are not actually stored but that can be formed from the facts by applying inference mechanisms based on the rule spec-ifications. The main difference between rules and views is that rules may involve recursion and hence may yield virtual relations that cannot be defined in terms of basic relational views. The evaluation of Prolog programs is based on a technique called backward chain- ing, which involves a top-down evaluation of goals. In the deductive databases that use Datalog, attention has been devoted to handling large volumes of data stored in a relational database.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, evaluation techniques have been devised that resemble those for a bottom-up evaluation. Prolog suffers from the limitation that the order of specification of facts and rules is significant in evaluation; moreover, the order of literals (defined in Section 26.5.3) within a rule is significant.

A predicate  has an implicit meaning, which is suggested by the predicate name, and a fixed number of arguments . If the arguments are all constant values, the predicate simply states that a certain fact is true. If, on the other hand, the pred-icate has variables as arguments, it is either considered as a query or as part of a rule or constraint.\n",

      "In our discussion, we adopt the Prolog convention that all constant values  in a predicate are either numeric  or character strings ; they are represented as identifiers (or names) that start with a lowercase letter , whereas variable names always start with an uppercase letter. Consider the example shown in Figure 26.11, which is based on the relational data- base in Figure 3.6, but in a much simplified form. There are three predicate names: supervise, superior,  and subordinate.\n",

      "Attribute names are only represented by virtue of the position of each argument in a predicate: the first argument represents the supervisor, and the second argument represents a direct subordinate. The other two predicate names are defined by rules. The main contributions of deductive databases are the ability to specify recursive rules and to provide a frame-work for inferring new information based on the specified rules. A rule is of the form head :– body , where :– is read as if and only if .\n",

      "A rule usually has a single predicate  to the left of the :– symbol—called the head  or left-hand side  (LHS) or conclusion  of the rule—and one or more  predicates  to the right of the :– symbol— called the body  or right-hand side  (RHS) or premise(s)  of the rule. A predicate with constants as arguments is said to be ground ; we also refer to it as an instanti ated predicate .\n",

A rule specifies that, if a particular assignment or binding  of constant values to the variables in the body (RHS predicates) makes all the RHS predicates true , it also makes the head (LHS predicate) true by using the same assignment of constant values to variables. Hence, a rule provides us with a way of generating new facts that are instantiations of the head of the rule.\n",

      "26.5.7 Use of Relational Operations It is straightforward to specify many operations of the relational algebra in the form of Datalog rules that define the result of applying these operations on the database relations (fact predicates). This means that relational queries and views can easily be specified in Datalog. The additional power that Datalog provides is in the speci-fication of recursive queries, and views based on recursive queries. In this section, we show how some of the standard relational operations can be specified as Datalog rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our examples will use the base relations (fact-defined predicates) REL_ONE , REL_TWO , and REL_THREE , whose schemas are shown in Figure 26.16. In Datalog, we do not need to specify the attribute names as in Figure 26.16; rather, the arity (degree) of each predicate is the important aspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a practical system, the domain (data type) of each attribute is also important for operations such as UNION , INTERSECTION , and JOIN , and we assume that the attribute types are compatible for the various operations, as discussed in Chapter 3. Figure 26.16 illustrates a number of basic relational operations. Notice that if the Datalog model is based on the relational model and hence assumes that predicates (fact relations and query results) specify sets of tuples, duplicate tuples in the same predicate are automatically eliminated.\n",
      "\n",
      "This may or may not be true, depending on the Datalog inference engine. However, it is definitely not the case in Prolog, so any of the rules in Figure 26.16 that involve duplicate elimination are not correct for Prolog. For example, if we want to specify Prolog rules for the UNION  operation with duplicate elimination, we must rewrite them as follows: UNION_ONE_TWO (X, Y, Z) :– REL_ONE (X, Y, Z).\n",
      "\n",
      "UNION_ONE_TWO (X, Y, Z) :– REL_TWO (X, Y, Z), NOT (REL_ONE (X, Y, Z)). However, the rules shown in Figure 26.16 should work for Datalog, if duplicates are automatically eliminated. Similarly, the rules for the PROJECT  operation shown in Figure 26.16 should work for Datalog in this case, but they are not correct for Pro- log, since duplicates would appear in the latter case.\n",
      "\n",
      "26.5.8 Evaluation of Nonrecursive Datalog Queries In order to use Datalog as a deductive database system, it is appropriate to define an inference mechanism based on relational database query processing concepts. The inherent strategy involves a bottom-up evaluation, starting with base relations; the order of operations is kept flexible and subject to query optimization. In this section we discuss an inference mechanism  based on relational operations that can be  26.5 Introduction to Deductive Databases  1011 applied to nonrecursive  Datalog queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "We use the fact and rule base shown in Figures 26.14 and 26.15 to illustrate our discussion. If a query involves only fact-defined predicates, the inference becomes one of searching among the facts for the query result. For example, a query such as DEPARTMENT (X, Research )? is a selection of all employee names X who work for the Research  department.\n",
      "\n",
      "In relational algebra, it is the query: π$1 (σ$2 = “Research”  (DEPARTMENT )) which can be answered by searching through the fact-defined predicate department (X, Y). The query involves relational SELECT  and PROJECT  operations on a base relation, and it can be handled by the database query processing and opti-mization techniques discussed in Chapter 19. When a query involves rule-defined predicates, the inference mechanism must compute the result based on the rule definitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a query is nonrecursive and involves a predicate p that appears as the head of a rule p :– p1, p2, … , pn, the strat- egy is first to compute the relations corresponding to p1, p2, … , pn and then to compute the relation corresponding to p. It is useful to keep track of the depen- dency among the predicates of a deductive database in a predicate dependency graph .\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 26.17 shows the graph for the fact and rule predicates shown in Fig- ures 26.14 and 26.15. The dependency graph contains a node  for each predicate. Whenever a predicate A is specified in the body (RHS) of a rule, and the head (LHS) of that rule is the predicate B, we say that B depends on  A, and we draw a directed edge from A to B.\n",
      "\n",
      "This indicates that in order to compute the facts for the predicate B (the rule head), we must first compute the facts for all the predicates A in the rule body. If the dependency graph has no cycles, we call the rule set nonre- cursive . If there is at least one cycle, we call the rule set recursive . In Figure 26.17, there is one recursively defined predicate—namely, SUPERIOR —which has a recursive edge pointing back to itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, because the predicate subordi-nate depends on SUPERIOR , it also requires recursion in computing its result. A query that includes only nonrecursive predicates is called a nonrecursive query . In this section we discuss only inference mechanisms for nonrecursive queries. In Figure 26.17, any query that does not involve the predicates SUBORDINATE  or SUPERIOR  is nonrecursive.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the predicate dependency graph, the nodes corre- sponding to fact-defined predicates do not have any incoming edges, since all fact- defined predicates have their facts stored in a database relation. The contents of a fact-defined predicate can be computed by directly retrieving the tuples in the cor- responding database relation. The main function of an inference mechanism is to compute the facts that corre- spond to query predicates.\n",
      "\n",
      "This can be accomplished by generating a relational expression  involving relational operators as SELECT , PROJECT , JOIN , UNION , and SET DIFFERENCE  (with appropriate provision for dealing with safety issues) that, when executed, provides the query result. The query can then be executed by utilizing the internal query processing and optimization operations of a relational database 1012 Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models management system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever the inference mechanism needs to compute the fact set corresponding to a nonrecursive rule-defined predicate p, it first locates all the rules that have p as their head. The idea is to compute the fact set for each such rule and then to apply the UNION  operation to the results, since UNION  corresponds to a logical OR operation. The dependency graph indicates all predicates q on which each p depends, and since we assume that the predicate is nonrecursive, we can always determine a partial order among such predicates q.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before computing the fact set for p, first we compute the fact sets for all predicates q on which p depends, based on their partial order. For example, if a query involves the predicate UNDER_40K_SUPERVISOR , we must first compute both SUPERVISOR  and OVER_40K_EMP . Since the latter two depend only on the fact-defined predicates EMPLOYEE , SALARY , and SUPERVISE , they can be computed directly from the stored database relations.\n",

      "26.6 Summary  1013 First in Section 26.1 we introduced the topic of active databases, which provide addi- tional functionality for specifying active rules. We introduced the event-condition-action (ECA) model for active databases. The rules can be automatically triggered by events that occur—such as a database update—and they can initiate certain actions that have been specified in the rule declaration if certain conditions are true. Many commercial packages have some of the functionality provided by active databases in the form of triggers.\n",
      "\n",
      "We gave examples of row-level triggers in the Oracle commercial system in Section 26.1.1. We discussed the different options for specifying triggers in Section 26.1.2, such as row-level versus statement-level, before versus after, and immediate versus deferred. Then in Section 26.1.3 we gave examples of statement-level rules in the STARBURST experimental system. We briefly discussed some design issues and some possible applications for active databases in Section 26.1.4.\n",
      "\n",
      "The syntax for triggers in the SQL-99 standard was also discussed in Section 26.1.5. Next in Section 26.2 we introduced some of the concepts of temporal databases, which permit the database system to store a history of changes and allow users to query both current and past states of the database. In Section 26.2.1, we discussed how time is represented and distinguished between the valid time and transaction time dimensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Section 26.2.2 we discussed how valid time, transaction time, and bitemporal relations can be implemented using tuple versioning in the rela-tional model, and we provided examples to illustrate how updates, inserts, and deletes are implemented. We also showed how complex objects can be used to implement temporal databases using attribute versioning in Section 26.2.3. We looked at some of the querying operations for temporal relational databases and gave a brief introduction to the TSQL2 language in Section 26.2.4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we turned to spatial databases in Section 26.3. Spatial databases provide concepts for databases that keep track of objects that have spatial characteristics. We gave an introduction to spatial databases in Section 26.3.1. We discussed the types of spatial data and spatial data models in Section 26.3.2, then the types of operators for processing spatial data and the types of spatial queries in Sec-tion 26.3.3. In Section 26.3.4, we gave an overview of spatial indexing techniques, including the popular R-trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we introduced some spatial data mining techniques in Section 26.3.5, and discussed some applications that require spatial databases in Section 26.3.6. In Section 26.4 we discussed some basic types of multimedia databases and their important characteristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Multimedia databases provide features that allow users to store and query different types of multimedia information, which includes images (such as pictures and drawings), video clips (such as movies, newsreels, and home videos), audio clips (such as songs, phone messages, and speeches), and doc-uments (such as books and articles). We provided a brief overview of the various types of media sources and how multimedia sources may be indexed. Images are an extremely common type of data among databases today and are likely to occupy a large proportion of stored data in databases.\n",
      "\n",
      "We therefore provided a more detailed treatment of images: their automatic analysis (Section 26.4.1), recognition of objects within images (Section 26.4.2), and their semantic tagging (Section 26.1.3)—all of which contribute to developing better systems to retrieve images by content, which 1014 Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models still remains a challenging problem. We also commented on the analysis of audio data sources in Section 26.4.4.\n",
      "\n",
      "We concluded the chapter with an introduction to deductive databases in Section 26.5. We introduced deductive databases in Section 26.5.1, and gave an overview of Prolog and Datalog notation in Sections 26.5.2 and 26.5.3. We discussed the clausal form of formulas in Section 26.5.4. Datalog rules are restricted to Horn clauses, which contain at most one positive literal.\n",

      "We discussed the proof-theoretic and model-theoretic interpretation of rules in Section 26.5.5.

      " Information retrieval  is the process of retrieving documents from a collection in response to a query (or a search request) by a user. This section provides an over-view of IR concepts. In Section 27.1.1, we introduce information retrieval in general and then discuss the different kinds and levels of search that IR encompasses. In Section 27.1.2, we compare IR and database technologies. Section 27.1.3 gives a brief history of IR.\n",
      "\n",
      "We then present the different modes of user interaction with IR systems in Section 27.1.4. In Section 27.1.5, we describe the typical IR process with a detailed set of tasks and then with a simplified process flow, and we end with a brief discussion of digital libraries and the Web.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.1.1 Introduction to Information Retrieval We first review the distinction between structured and unstructured data (see Sec-tion 13.1) to see how information retrieval differs from structured data manage-ment. Consider a relation (or table) called HOUSES  with the attributes: HOUSES (Lot# , Address , Square_footage , Listed_price ) This is an example of structured data . We can compare this relation with home- buying contract documents, which are examples of unstructured data .\n",
      "\n",
      "These types of documents can vary from city to city, and even county to county, within a given state in the United States. Typically, a contract document in a particular state will have a standard list of clauses described in paragraphs within sections of the docu-ment, with some predetermined (fixed) text and some variable areas whose content is to be supplied by the specific buyer and seller. Other variable information would include interest rate for financing, down-payment amount, closing dates, and so on. The documents could also include pictures taken during a home inspection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The information content in such documents can be considered unstructured data that can be stored in a variety of possible arrangements and formats. By  unstructured information , we generally mean information that does not have a well-defined formal model and corresponding formal language for representation and reason-ing, but rather is based on understanding of natural language. With the advent of the World Wide Web (or Web, for short), the volume of unstructured information stored in messages and documents that contain textual and multimedia information has exploded.\n",
      "\n",
      "These documents are stored in a variety of standard formats, including HTML, XML (see Chapter 13), and several audio and video formatting standards. Information retrieval deals with the problems of storing, indexing, and retrieving (searching) such information to satisfy the needs of users. The problems that IR deals with are exacerbated by the fact that the num-ber of Web pages and the number of social interaction events is already in the bil-lions and is growing at a phenomenal rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "All forms of unstructured data described above are being added at the rates of millions per day, expanding the searchable space on the Web at rapidly increasing rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, information retrieval  is “the discipline that deals with the structure, analysis, organization, storage, searching, and retrieval of information” as defined  27.1 Information Retrieval (IR) Concepts  1023 by Gerald Salton, an IR pioneer.2 We can enhance the definition slightly to say that it applies in the context of unstructured documents to satisfy a user’s information needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "This field has existed even longer than the database field and was originally concerned with retrieval of cataloged information in libraries based on titles, authors, topics, and keywords. In academic programs, the field of IR has long been a part of Library and Information Science programs. Information in the context of IR does not require machine-understandable structures, such as in relational data-base systems. Examples of such information include written texts, abstracts, docu-ments, books, Web pages, e-mails, instant messages, and collections from digital libraries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, all loosely represented (unstructured) or semistructured infor-mation is also part of the IR discipline. We introduced XML modeling and retrieval in Chapter 13 and discussed advanced data types, including spatial, temporal, and multimedia data, in Chapter 26. RDBMS vendors are providing modules to support many of these data types,  as well as XML data, in the newer versions of their products.\n",
      "\n",
      "These newer versions are sometimes referred to as extended RDBMSs , or object-relational database management systems (ORDBMSs; see Chapter 12). The challenge of dealing with unstructured data is largely an information retrieval problem, although database researchers have been applying database indexing and search techniques to some of these problems. IR systems go beyond database systems in that they do not limit the user to a spe- cific query language, nor do they expect the user to know the structure (schema) or content of a particular database.\n",
      "\n",
      "IR systems use a user’s information need expressed as a free-form search request  (sometimes called a keyword search query , or just query ) for interpretation by the system. Whereas the IR field historically dealt with cataloging, processing, and accessing text in the form of documents for decades, in today’s world the use of Web search engines is becoming the dominant way to find information. The traditional problems of text indexing and making collections of documents searchable have been transformed by making the Web itself into a quickly accessible repository of human knowledge or a virtual digital library.\n",
      "\n",
      "An IR system can be characterized at different levels: by types of users , types of data , and the types of the information need , along with the size and scale of the informa- tion repository it addresses. Different IR systems are designed to address specific problems that require a combination of different characteristics. These characteris-tics can be briefly described as follows: Types of Users. Users can greatly vary in their abilities to interact with compu- tational systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "This ability depends on a multitude of factors, such as educa-tion, culture, and past exposure to computational environments. The user may be an expert user  (for example, a curator or a librarian) who is searching for specific information that is clear in his/her mind, understands the scope and the structure of the available repository, and forms relevant queries for the task, or a layperson user  with a generic information need.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latter cannot create highly relevant queries for search (for example, students trying to find infor- mation about a new topic, researchers trying to assimilate different points of 2See Salton’s 1968 book entitled Automatic Information Organization and Retrieval .1024 Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search view about a historical issue, a scientist verifying a claim by another scientist, or a person trying to shop for clothing).\n",

Search systems can be tailored to specific types of data. For exam- ple, the problem of retrieving information about a specific topic may be handled more efficiently by customized search systems that are built to collect and retrieve only information related to that specific topic. The information repository could be hierarchically organized based on a concept or topic hierarchy.\n",
      "\n",
      "These topical domain-specific  or vertical IR systems  are not as large as or as diverse as the generic World Wide Web, which contains information on all kinds of topics. Given that these domain-specific collections exist and may have been acquired through a specific process, they can be exploited much more efficiently by a specialized sys- tem. Types of data can have different dimensions, such as velocity , variety , vol- ume, and veracity. We discussed these in Section 25.1. Types of Information Need.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of Web search, users’ information needs may be defined as navigational, informational, or transactional. 3 Naviga- tional search  refers to finding a particular piece of information (such as the Georgia Tech University Web site) that a user needs quickly. The purpose of informational search  is to find current information about a topic (such as research activities in the college of computing at Georgia Tech—this is the clas- sic IR system task).\n",

Levels of Scale. In the words of Nobel Laureate Herbert Simon, “What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of informa-tion sources that might consume it.” 4 This overabundance of information sources in effect creates a high noise-to-signal ratio in IR systems. Especially on the Web, where billions of pages are indexed, IR interfaces are built with efficient scalable algorithms for distributed searching, index-ing, caching, merging, and fault tolerance. IR search engines can be limited in level to more specific collections of documents.\n",

Enterprise search systems still typically deal with hundreds of millions of entities in large global enterprises.\n",

      "27.1.2 Databases and IR Systems: A Comparison Within the computer science discipline, databases and IR systems are closely related fields. Databases deal with structured information retrieval through well-defined formal languages for representation and manipulation based on the theoretically founded data models. Efficient algorithms have been developed for operators that allow rapid execution of complex queries. IR, on the other hand, deals with unstruc-tured search with possibly vague query or search semantics and without a well-defined logical schematic representation.\n",

      "Some of the key differences between databases and IR systems are listed in Table 27.1. Whereas databases have fixed schemas defined in some data model such as the rela- tional model, an IR system has no fixed data model; it views data or documents according to some scheme, such as the vector space model, to aid in query process-ing (see Section 27.2). Databases using the relational model employ SQL for queries and transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The queries are mapped into relational algebra operations and search algorithms (see Chapter 19) and return a new relation (table) as the query result, providing an exact answer to the query for the current state of the database. In IR systems, there is no fixed language for defining the structure (schema) of the document or for operating on the document—queries tend to be a set of query terms (keywords) or a free-form natural language phrase.\n",
      "\n",
      "An IR query result is a list of document id’s, or some pieces of text or multimedia objects (images, videos, and so on), or a list of links to Web pages. The result of a database query is an exact answer; if no matching records (tuples) are found in the relation, the result is empty (null).\n",

      "Whereas database systems maintain a large amount of metadata and allow their use in query optimization, the operations in IR systems rely on the data values themselves and their occurrence frequencies. Complex statistical analysis is sometimes performed to determine the relevance  of each document or parts of a document to the user request.\n",

      "27.1.3 A Brief History of IR Information retrieval has been a common task since the times of ancient civiliza-tions, which devised ways to organize, store, and catalog documents and records. Media such as papyrus scrolls and stone tablets were used to record documented information in ancient times. These efforts allowed knowledge to be retained and transferred among generations. With the emergence of public libraries and the printing press, large-scale methods for producing, collecting, archiving, and dis-tributing documents and books evolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "As computers and automatic storage sys-tems emerged, the need to apply these methods to computerized systems arose. Several techniques emerged in the 1950s, such as the seminal work of H. P. Luhn, 5 who proposed using words and their frequency counts as indexing units for docu-ments, and using measures of word overlap between queries and documents as the retrieval criterion. It was soon realized that storing large amounts of text was not difficult. The harder task was to search for and retrieve that information selectively for users with specific information needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods that explored word distribution statistics gave rise to the choice of keywords based on their distribution properties 6 and also led to keyword-based weighting schemes. The earlier experiments with document retrieval systems such as SMART7 in the 1960s adopted the inverted file organization  based on keywords and their weights as the method of indexing (see Section 17.6.4 on inverted indexing).

This has spurred the rapid growth in search engine technology, where search engines are trying to discover different kinds of real-time content found on the Web. The part of a search engine responsible for discovering, analyzing, and indexing these new documents is known as a crawler . Other types of search engines exist for specific domains of knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the biomedical literature search database was started in the 1970s and is now supported by the PubMed search engine, 9 which gives access to over 24 million abstracts. Although continuous progress is being made to tailor search results to the needs of an end user, the challenge remains in providing high-quality, pertinent, and timely information that is precisely aligned to the information needs of individual users.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.1.4 Modes of Interaction in IR Systems In the beginning of Section 27.1, we defined information retrieval  as the process of retrieving documents from a collection in response to a query (or a search request) by a user. Typically the collection is made up of documents containing unstruc-tured data. Other kinds of documents include images, audio recordings, video strips, and maps. Data may be scattered nonuniformly in these documents with no definitive structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "A query  is a set of terms  (also referred to as keywords ) used by the searcher to specify an information need (for example, the terms databases  and operating systems  may be regarded as a query to a computer science bibliographic database). An informational request or a search query may also be a natural lan-guage phrase or a question (for example, “What is the currency of China?” or “Find Italian restaurants in Sarasota, Florida.”).\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two main modes of interaction with IR systems—retrieval and brows- ing—which, although similar in goal, are accomplished through different interac-tion tasks. Retrieval  is concerned with the extraction of relevant information from a repository of documents through an IR query, whereas browsing  signifies the exploratory activity of a user visiting or navigating through similar or related docu-ments based on the user’s assessment of relevance. During browsing, a user’s infor-mation need may not be defined a priori  and is flexible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider the following browsing scenario: A user specifies ‘Atlanta’ as a keyword. The information retrieval system retrieves links to relevant result documents containing various aspects of Atlanta for the user. The user comes across the term ‘Georgia Tech’ in one of the returned documents and uses some access technique (such as clicking on the phrase ‘Georgia Tech’ in a document that has a built-in link) and visits documents about Georgia Tech in the same or a different Web site (repository).\n",
      "\n",
      "There the user finds an entry for ‘Athletics’ that leads the user to information about various athletic pro-grams at Georgia Tech. Eventually, the user ends his search at the Fall schedule for the Yellow Jackets football team, which he finds to be of great interest. This user activity is known as browsing. Hyperlinks  are used to interconnect Web pages and are mainly used for browsing. Anchor texts  are text phrases within documents used to label hyperlinks and are very relevant to browsing.\n",
      "\n",
      "9See www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1028 Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search Web search  combines both aspects—browsing and retrieval—and is one of the main applications of information retrieval today. Web pages are analogous to docu-ments. Web search engines maintain an indexed repository of Web pages, usually using the technique of inverted indexing (see Section 27.5).\n",
      "\n",
      "They retrieve the most relevant Web pages for the user in response to the user’s search request with a pos-sible ranking in descending order of relevance. The rank of a Web page  in a retrieved set is the measure of its relevance to the query that generated the result set.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.1.5 Generic IR Pipeline As we mentioned earlier, documents are made up of unstructured natural language text composed of character strings from English and other languages. Common examples of documents include newswire services (such as AP or Reuters), corporate manuals and reports, government notices, Web page articles, blogs, tweets, books, and journal papers. There are two main approaches to IR: statistical and semantic.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statistical approach , documents are analyzed and broken down into chunks of text (words, phrases, or n-grams, which are all subsequences of length n characters in a text or document) and each word or phrase is counted, weighted, and mea-sured for relevance or importance. These words and their properties are then com-pared with the query terms for potential degree of match to produce a ranked list of resulting documents that contain the words. Statistical approaches are further clas-sified based on the method employed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three main statistical approaches are Boolean, vector space, and probabilistic (see Section 27.2). Semantic approaches  to IR use knowledge-based techniques of retrieval that broadly rely on the syntactic, lexical, sentential, discourse-based, and pragmatic levels of knowledge understanding. In practice, semantic approaches also apply some form of statistical analysis to improve the retrieval process. Figure 27.1 shows the various stages involved in an IR processing system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The steps shown on the left in Figure 27.1 are typically offline processes, which prepare a set of documents for efficient retrieval; these are document preprocessing, document modeling, and indexing. The right side of Figure 27.1 deals with the process of a user interacting with the IR system either during a querying, browsing, or searching. It shows the steps involved; namely, query formation, query processing, searching mechanism, document retrieval, and relevance feedback, In each box, we highlight the important concepts and issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of this chapter describes some of the concepts involved in the various tasks within the IR process shown in Figure 27.1. Figure 27.2 shows a simplified IR processing pipeline. In order to perform retrieval on documents, the documents are first represented in a form suitable for retrieval. The significant terms and their properties are extracted from the documents and are represented in a document index where the words/terms and their properties are stored in a matrix that contains each individual document in a row and each row contains the references to the words contained in those documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "This index is then converted into an inverted index (see Figure 27.4) of a word/term versus document matrix. Given the query words, the documents containing these words— 27.2 Retrieval Models  1029 and the document properties, such as date of creation, author, and type of docu- ment—are fetched from the inverted index and compared with the query. This comparison results in a ranked list shown to the user.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user can then provide feedback on the results that triggers implicit or explicit query modification and expansion to fetch results that are more relevant for the user. Most IR systems allow for an interactive search in which the query and the results are successively refined.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.2 Retrieval Models In this section, we briefly describe the important models of IR. These are the three main statistical models—Boolean, vector space, and probabilistic—and the semantic model.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.2.1 Boolean Model In this model, documents are represented as a set of terms . Queries are formulated as a combination of terms using the standard Boolean logic set-theoretic operators such as AND , OR and NOT . Retrieval and relevance are considered as binary con- cepts in this model, so the retrieved elements are an “exact match” retrieval of rele-vant documents. There is no notion of ranking of resulting documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "All retrieved documents are considered equally important—a major simplification that does not consider frequencies of document terms or their proximity to other terms com- pared against the query terms. Boolean retrieval models lack sophisticated ranking algorithms and are among the earliest and simplest information retrieval models.\n",
      "\n",
      "These models make it easy to associate metadata information and write queries that match the contents of the documents as well as other properties of documents, such as date of creation, author, and type of document.Documents EXTRACT FEEDBACK QUERY FETCHPROCESS Inverted IndexCOMPARE Query x DocumentsRANKDocument #4Document #3Document #2Document #1 Result #3Result #2Result #1IndexD1 1 1 0 1 1 0...

      "27.2.2 Vector Space Model The vector space model provides a framework in which term weighting, ranking of retrieved documents, and determining the relevance of feedback are possible. Using individual terms as dimensions, each document is represented by an n-dimensional vector of values. The values themselves may be a Boolean value to represent the existence or absence of the term in that document; alternately, they may be a number representative of the weight or frequency in the document.\n",
      "\n",
      "Features  are a subset of the terms in a set of documents  that are deemed most rele vant to an IR search for this particular set of documents. The process of selecting these important terms (features) and their properties as a sparse (limited) list out of the very large number of available terms (the vocabulary can contain hundreds of thou-sands of terms) is independent of the model specification. The query is also speci-fied as a terms vector (vector of features), and this is compared to the document vectors for similarity/relevance assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The similarity assessment function that compares two vectors is not inherent to the model—different similarity functions can be used. However, the cosine of the angle between the query and document vector is a commonly used function for similarity assessment. As the angle between the vectors decreases, the cosine of the angle approaches one, meaning that the similarity of the query with a document vector increases. Terms (features) are weighted proportional to their frequency counts to reflect the importance of terms in the calculation of relevance measure.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is dif-ferent from the Boolean model, which does not take into account the frequency of words in the document for relevance match. In the vector model, the document term weight w ij (for term i in document j) is represented based on some variation of the TF (term frequency) or TF-IDF (term frequency–inverse document frequency) scheme (as we will describe below). TF-IDF is a statistical weight measure that is used to evaluate the importance of a document word in a collection of documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following formula is typically used: cosine<dj, q> = <dj x q> / ||dj|| x ||q|| = ∑ from i = 1 to |V| [wij x wiq]  / sqrt(∑ from i = 1 to |V| [wij^2]) from i = 1 to |V| [wiq^2] In the formula given above, we use the following symbols: ■dj is the document vector for document j. ■q is the query vector. ■wij is the weight of term i in document j.\n",
      "\n",
      "■wiq is the weight of term i in query vector q. ■|V| is the number of dimensions in the vector that is the total number of important keywords (or features). TF-IDF uses the product of normalized frequency of a term i (TFij) in document Dj and the inverse document frequency of the term i (IDF i) to weight a term in a 1032 Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search document.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea is that terms that capture the essence of a document occur frequently in the document (that is, their TF is high), but if such a term were to be a good term that discriminates the document from others, it must occur in only a few documents in the general population (that is, its IDF should be high as well). IDF values can be easily computed for a fixed collection of documents. In case of Web search engines, taking a representative sample of documents approximates IDF computation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following formulas can be used: TFij = fij / ∑ from i = 1 to |V| [fij] IDFi = log( N / i) In these formulas, the meaning of the symbols is: ■TFij is the normalized term frequency of term i in document Dj. ■fij is the number of occurrences of term i in document Dj. ■IDF i is the inverse document frequency weight for term i. ■N is the number of documents in the collection. ■ni is the number of documents in which term i occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that if a term i occurs in all documents, then ni = N and hence IDF i = log(1) becomes zero, nullifying its importance and creating a situation where division by zero can occur. The weight of term i in document j, w ij, is computed based on its TF-IDF value in some techniques. To prevent division by zero, it is common to add a 1 to the denominator in the formulae such as the cosine formula above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, the relevance of the document with respect to a query (rel( D j,Q)) is directly measured as the sum of the TF-IDF values of the terms in the query Q: rel(Dj , Q) = ∑ for i in Q [TFij x IDFi] The normalization factor (similar to the denominator of the cosine formula) is incorporated into the TF-IDF formula itself, thereby measuring relevance of a doc-ument to the query by the computation of the dot product of the query and docu-ment vectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rocchio 10 algorithm is a well-known relevance feedback algorithm based on the vector space model that modifies the initial query vector and its weights in response to user-identified relevant documents. It expands the original query vec- tor q to a new vector q e as follows: qqDdDde rr nr dDnr dDr r nr nr=+ − ∈∈∑∑ /H9251/H9252/H9253 || | |, 10See Rocchio (1971).\n",

Terms from relevant and nonrelevant documents get added to the original query vector with positive and negative weights, respectively, to create the modified query vector. a, b, and g are parameters of the equation. The summation over d r repre- sents summation over all relevant terms of document dr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, summation over dnr represents summation over all nonrelevant terms of document dnr. The values of these parameters determine how the feedback affects the original query, and these may be determined after a number of trial-and-error experiments.\n",

      "27.2.3 Probabilistic Model The similarity measures in the vector space model are somewhat ad hoc. For exam-ple, the model assumes that those documents closer to the query in cosine space are more relevant to the query vector. In the probabilistic model, a more concrete and definitive approach is taken: ranking documents by their estimated probability of relevance with respect to the query and the document. This is the basis of the prob- ability ranking principle  developed by Robertson.\n",
      "\n",
      "11 In the probabilistic framework, the IR system must decide whether the documents belong to the relevant set  or the nonrelevant set  for a query. To make this decision, it is assumed that a predefined relevant set and nonrelevant set exist for the query, and the task is to calculate the probability that the document belongs to the relevant set and compare that with the probability that the document belongs to the nonrelevant set.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the document representation D of a document, estimating the relevance R and nonrelevance NR of that document involves computation of conditional prob- ability P(R|D) and P(NR|D). These conditional probabilities can be calculated using Bayes’ rule: 12 P(R|D) = P(D|R) × P(R)/P(D) P(NR|D) = P(D|NR) × P(NR)/P(D) A document D is classified as relevant if P(R|D) > P(NR|D ).\n",

      "Discarding the constant P(D), this is equivalent to saying that a document is relevant if: P(D|R) × P(R) > P(D|NR ) × P(NR) The likelihood ratio P(D|R)/P(D|NR ) is used as a score to determine the likelihood of the document with representation D belonging to the relevant set. The term independence  or naïve Bayes  assumption is used to estimate P(D|R) using computation of P(ti|R) for term ti.\n",
      "\n",
      "The likelihood ratios P(D|R) /P(D|NR ) of documents are used as a proxy for ranking based on the assumption that highly ranked documents will have a high likelihood of belonging to the relevant set.13 12Bayes’ theorem is a standard technique for measuring likelihood; see Howson and Urbach (1993), for example.11For a description of the Cheshire II system, see Robertson (1997). 13Readers should refer to Croft et al.\n",

      "27.2.4 Semantic Model However sophisticated the above statistical models become, they can miss many relevant documents because those models do not capture the complete meaning or information need conveyed by a user’s query. In semantic models, the process of matching documents to a given query is based on concept level and semantic matching instead of index term (keyword) matching. This allows retrieval of rele-vant documents that share meaningful associations with other documents in the query result, even when these associations are not inherently observed or statisti-cally captured.\n",

      "Semantic approaches include different levels of analysis, such as morphological, syntactic, and semantic analysis, to retrieve documents more effectively. In  morphological analysis , roots and affixes are analyzed to determine the parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and so on) of the words. Following morphological analysis, syntactic analysis  follows to parse and analyze complete phrases in docu- ments.\n",

      "These systems often require techniques from artificial intelligence and expert systems. Knowledge bases like Cyc 15 and WordNet16 have been developed for use in knowledge-based IR sys- tems  based on semantic models. The Cyc knowledge base, for example, is a repre- sentation of a vast quantity of commonsense knowledge. It presently contains 15.94 million assertions, 498,271 atomic concepts, and 441,159 nonatomic derived con-cepts for reasoning about the objects and events of everyday life.\n",

      "27.3 Types of Queries in IR Systems   Different keywords are associated with the document set during the process of indexing. These keywords generally consist of words, phrases, and other character-izations of documents such as date created, author names, and type of document. They are used by an IR system to build an inverted index (see Section 27.5), which is then consulted during the search. The queries formulated by users are compared to the set of index keywords. Most IR systems also allow the use of Boolean and other operators to build a complex query.\n",
      "\n",
      "The query language with these operators enriches the expressiveness of a user’s information need.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.3.1 Keyword Queries Keyword-based queries are the simplest and most commonly used forms of IR que-ries: the user just enters keyword combinations to retrieve documents. The query keyword terms are implicitly connected by a logical AND  operator. A query such as ‘database concepts’ retrieves documents that contain both the words ‘database’ and ‘concepts’ at the top of the retrieved results. In addition, most systems also retrieve documents that contain only ‘database’ or only ‘concepts’ in their text.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some sys-tems remove most commonly occurring words (such as a, the, of, and so on, called stopwords ) as a preprocessing step before sending the filtered query keywords to the IR engine. Most IR systems do not pay attention to the ordering of these words in the query. All retrieval models provide support for keyword queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.3.2 Boolean Queries Some IR systems allow using the AND , OR, NOT , ( ), + , and − Boolean operators in combinations of keyword formulations. AND requires that both terms be found. OR lets either term be found. NOT means any record containing the second term will be excluded. ‘( )’ means the Boolean operators can be nested using parentheses. ‘+’ is equivalent to AND , requiring the term; the ‘+’ should be placed directly in front 15See Lenat (1995).\n",

      "16See Miller (1990) for a detailed description of WordNet.1036 Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search of the search term. ‘–’ is equivalent to AND NOT and means to exclude the term; the ‘–’ should be placed directly in front of the search term not wanted. Complex Boolean queries can be built out of these operators and their combinations, and they are evaluated according to the classical rules of Boolean algebra.\n",
      "\n",
      "No ranking is possible, because a document either satisfies such a query (is “relevant”) or does not satisfy it (is “nonrelevant”). A document is retrieved for a Boolean query if the query is logically true as an exact match in the document. Users generally do not use combinations of these complex Boolean operators, and IR systems support a restricted version of these set operators. Boolean retrieval models can directly sup-port different Boolean operator implementations for these kinds of queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.3.3 Phrase Queries When documents are represented using an inverted keyword index for searching, the relative order of the terms in the document is lost. In order to perform exact phrase retrieval, these phrases should be encoded in the inverted index or imple-mented differently (with relative positions of word occurrences in documents). A phrase query consists of a sequence of words that makes up a phrase. The phrase is generally enclosed within double quotes. Each retrieved document must contain at least one instance of the exact phrase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phrase searching is a more restricted and spe-cific version of proximity searching that we mention below. For example, a phrase searching query could be ‘conceptual database design’. If phrases are indexed by the retrieval model, any retrieval model can be used for these query types. A phrase the-saurus may also be used in semantic models for fast dictionary searching of phrases.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.3.4 Proximity Queries Proximity search refers to a search that accounts for how close within a record mul-tiple terms should be to each other. The most commonly used proximity search option is a phrase search that requires terms to be in the exact order. Other proxim-ity operators can specify how close terms should be to each other. Some will also specify the order of the search terms. Each search engine can define proximity operators differently, and the search engines use various operator names such as NEAR, ADJ(adjacent), or AFTER.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases, a sequence of single words is given, together with a maximum allowed distance between them. Vector space models that also maintain information about positions and offsets of tokens (words) have robust implementations for this query type. However, providing support for complex proximity operators becomes computationally expensive because it requires the time-consuming preprocessing of documents and is thus suitable for smaller document collections rather than for the Web.\n",

      "27.3.5 Wildcard Queries Wildcard searching is generally meant to support regular expressions and pattern matching–based searching in text. In IR systems, certain kinds of wildcard search sup-port may be implemented—usually words with any trailing characters (for example, ‘data*’ would retrieve data, database , datapoint , dataset , and so on).\n",
      "\n",
      "Providing full  support  27.4 Text Preprocessing  1037 for wildcard searches in Web search engines involves preprocessing overhead and is not generally implemented by many Web search engines today.17 Retrieval models do not directly provide support for this query type.

      "27.3.6 Natural Language Queries There are a few natural language search engines that aim to understand the structure and meaning of queries written in natural language text, generally as a question or nar-rative. This is an active area of research that employs techniques like shallow semantic parsing of text, or query reformulations based on natural language understanding. The system tries to formulate answers for such queries from retrieved results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some search systems are starting to provide natural language interfaces to provide answers to spe-cific types of questions, such as definition and factoid questions, which ask for defini-tions of technical terms or common facts that can be retrieved from specialized databases. Such questions are usually easier to answer because there are strong linguis-tic patterns giving clues to specific types of sentences—for example, ‘defined as’ or ‘refers to’. Semantic models can provide support for this query type.\n",

      "Many search engines do not employ query stopword removal for this reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.4.2 Stemming A stem  of a word is defined as the word obtained after trimming the suffix and pre- fix of an original word. For example, ‘comput’ is the stem word for computer , com- puting , computable , and computation . These suffixes and prefixes are very common in the English language for supporting the notion of verbs, tenses, and plural forms. Stemming  reduces the different forms of the word formed by inflection (due to plurals or tenses) and derivation to a common stem.\n",
      "\n",
      "A stemming algorithm can be applied to reduce any word to its stem. In English, the most famous stemming algorithm is Martin Porter’s stemming algorithm. The Porter stemmer 20 is a simplified version of Lovin’s technique that uses a reduced set of about 60 rules (from 260 suffix patterns in Lovin’s technique) and organizes them into sets; conflicts within one subset of rules are resolved before going on to the next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using stemming for preprocessing data results in a decrease in the size of the indexing structure and an increase in recall, possibly at the cost of precision.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.4.3 Utilizing a Thesaurus A thesaurus  comprises a precompiled list of important concepts and the main word that describes each concept for a particular domain of knowledge. For each concept in this list, a set of synonyms and related words is also compiled. 21 Thus, a synonym can be converted to its matching concept during preprocessing. This pre- processing step assists in providing a standard vocabulary for indexing and search- ing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Usage of a thesaurus, also known as a collection of synonyms , has a substantial impact on the recall of information systems. This process can be complicated because many words have different meanings in different contexts. UMLS 22 is a large biomedical thesaurus of millions of concepts (called the meta- thesaurus ) and a semantic network of meta concepts and relationships that organize the metathesaurus (see Figure 27.3). The concepts are assigned labels from the semantic network.\n",
      "\n",
      "This thesaurus of concepts contains synonyms of medical terms, hierarchies of broader and narrower terms, and other relationships among words and concepts that make it a very extensive resource for information retrieval of documents in the medical domain. Figure 27.3 illustrates part of the UMLS Semantic Network. 20See Porter (1980). 21See Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto (1999). 22Unified Medical Language System from the National Library of Medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.4 Text Preprocessing  1039 WordNet23 is a manually constructed thesaurus that groups words into strict syn- onym sets called synsets . These synsets are divided into noun, verb, adjective, and adverb categories. Within each category, these synsets are linked together by appro- priate relationships such as class/subclass or “is-a” relationships for nouns. WordNet is based on the idea of using a controlled vocabulary for indexing, thereby eliminating redundancies.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also useful in providing assistance to users with locating terms for proper query formulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.4.4 Other Preprocessing Steps: Digits, Hyphens, Punctuation Marks, Cases Digits, dates, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, URLs, and other standard types of text may or may not be removed during preprocessing. Web search engines, how-ever, index them in order to use this type of information in the document metadata to improve precision and recall (see Section 27.6 for detailed definitions of precision and recall ).Organ or Hyphens and punctuation marks may be handled in different ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either the entire phrase with the hyphens/punctuation marks may be used, or they may be eliminated. In some systems, the character representing the hyphen/punctuation mark may be removed, or may be replaced with a space. Different information retrieval systems follow different rules of processing. Handling hyphens automati-cally can be complex: it can either be done as a classification problem, or more com-monly by some heuristic rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the StandardTokenizer in Lucene 24 treats the hyphen as a delimeter to break words—with the exception that if there is a number in the token, the words are not split (for example, words like AK-47, phone numbers, etc.). Many domain-specific terms like product catalogs, different versions of a product, and so on have hyphens in them. When search engines crawl the Web for indexing, it becomes difficult to automatically treat hyphens correctly; therefore, simpler strategies are devised to process hyphens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most information retrieval systems perform case-insensitive search, converting all the letters of the text to uppercase or lowercase. It is also worth noting that many of these text preprocessing steps are language specific, such as involving accents and diacritics and the idiosyncrasies that are associated with a particular language.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.4.5 Information Extraction Information extraction  (IE) is a generic term used for extracting structured con- tent from text. Text analytic tasks such as identifying noun phrases, facts, events, people, places, and relationships are examples of IE tasks. These tasks are also called named entity recognition tasks  and use rule-based approaches with either a thesaurus, regular expressions and grammars, or probabilistic approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "For IR and search applications, IE technologies are mostly used to identify named entities that involve text analysis, matching, and categorization for improving the rele-vance of search systems. Language technologies using part-of-speech tagging are applied to semantically annotate the documents with extracted features to aid search relevance.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.5 Inverted Indexing   The simplest way to search for occurrences of query terms in text collections can be performed by sequentially scanning the text. This kind of online searching is only appropriate when text collections are small. Most information retrieval systems process the text collections to create indexes and operate upon the inverted index data structure (refer to the indexing task in Figure 27.1). An inverted index struc-ture comprises vocabulary and document information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vocabulary  is a set of dis- tinct query terms in the document set. Each term in a vocabulary set has an associated collection of information about the documents that contain the term, such as document id, occurrence count, and offsets within the document where the 24See further details on StandardTokenizer at https://lucene.apache.org/ 27.5 Inverted Indexing  1041 term occurs. The simplest form of vocabulary terms consists of words or individual tokens of the documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases, these vocabulary terms also consist of phrases, n-grams, entities, links, names, dates, or manually assigned descriptor terms from documents and/or Web pages. For each term in the vocabulary, the cor-responding document id’s, occurrence locations of the term in each document, number of occurrences of the term in each document, and other relevant informa-tion may be stored in the document information section.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weights are assigned to document terms to represent an estimate of the usefulness of the given term as a descriptor for distinguishing the given document from other documents in the same collection. A term may be a better descriptor of one docu-ment than of another by the weighting process (see Section 27.2). An inverted index  of a document collection is a data structure that attaches distinct terms with a list of all documents that contains the term. The process of inverted index construction involves the extraction and processing steps shown in Fig-ure 27.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Acquired text is first preprocessed and the documents are represented with the vocabulary terms. Documents’ statistics are collected in document lookup tables. Statistics generally include counts of vocabulary terms in individual docu-ments as well as different collections, their positions of occurrence within the docu-ments, and the lengths of the documents. The vocabulary terms are weighted at indexing time according to different criteria for collections. For example, in some cases terms in the titles of the documents may be weighted more heavily than terms that occur in other parts of the documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most popular weighting schemes is the TF-IDF (term frequency–inverse document frequency) metric that we described in Section 27.2. For a given term, this weighting scheme distinguishes to some extent the documents in which the term occurs more often from those in which the term occurs very little or never. These weights are normalized to account for varying document lengths, further ensuring that longer documents with proportionately more occurrences of a word are not favored for retrieval over shorter documents with proportionately fewer occurrences.\n",
      "\n",
      "These processed document-term streams (matrices) are then inverted into term-document streams (matrices) for further IR steps. Figure 27.4 shows an illustration of term-document-position vectors for the four illustrative terms— example , inverted , index , and market —which shows the posi- tions where each term occurs in the three documents. The steps involved in inverted index construction can be summarized as follows: 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Break the documents into vocabulary terms by tokenizing, cleansing, remov- ing stopwords, stemming, and/or using an additional thesaurus as vocabulary. 2. Collect document statistics and store the statistics in a document lookup table. 3.\n",

      "Invert the document-term stream into a term-document stream along with additional information such as term frequencies, term positions, and term weights.1042 Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search Searching for relevant documents from the inverted index, given a set of query terms, is generally a three-step process. 1. Vocabulary search. If the query comprises multiple terms, they are sepa- rated and treated as independent terms. Each term is searched in the vocab-ulary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Various data structures, like variations of B +-tree or hashing, may be used to optimize the search process. Query terms may also be ordered in lexicographic order to improve space efficiency. 2. Document information retrieval. The document information for each term is retrieved. 3. Manipulation of retrieved information. The document information vector for each term obtained in step 2 is now processed further to incorporate various forms of query logic.\n",

      "Various kinds of queries like prefix, range, context, and proximity queries are processed in this step to construct the final result based on the document collections returned in step 2. Lucene is an actively maintained open source indexing/search engine that has become popular in both academic and commercial settings. Indexing is the primary focus of Lucene, but it uses indexing to facilitate search. The Lucene library is writ-ten in Java and comes with out-of-the-box scalable and high-performance capabil-ity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucene is the engine that powers another widely popular enterprise search application called Solr. 25 Solr provides many add-on capabilities to Lucene, such as providing Web interfaces for indexing many different document formats. An upcoming book by Moczar (2015) discusses both Lucene and Solr. Indexing: In Lucene, documents must go through a process of indexing before they become available for search. A Lucene document is made up of a set of fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fields hold the type of data in the index and are loosely comparable to columns in a database table. A field can be of type binary, numeric, or text data. Text fields consist of either entire chunk of untokenized text or a series of processed lexical units called token streams. The token streams are created via application of different types of available tokenization and filtering algorithms. For example, StandardTokenizer is one of the available tokenizers in Lucene that implements Unicode text segmentation for split-ting words apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are other tokenizers, such as a WhitespaceTokenizer, that divide text at whitespaces. It is also easy to extend these tokenizers and filters in Lucene to create custom text analysis algorithms for tokenization and filtering. These analysis algorithms are central to achieving desired search results. Lucene provides APIs and several implementations for many high-speed and efficient tokenization and filtering algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "These algorithms have been extended for several different languages and domains, and they feature implementations of natural language pro-cessing algorithms for stemming, conducting dictionary-driven lemmatization, per-forming morphological analysis, conducting phonetic analysis, and so on. Search: With a powerful search API, queries are matched against documents and a ranked list of results is retrieved. Queries are compared against the term vectors in inverted indexes to compute relevance scores based on the vector space model (see Sec-tion 27.2.2).\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucene provides a highly configurable search API wherein one can create queries for wildcard, exact, Boolean, proximity, and range searches. Lucene’s default scoring algorithm uses variants of TF-IDF scoring to rank search results. To speed up search, Lucene maintains document-dependent normalization factors precomputed at index time; these are called norms of term vectors in document fields. These precom-puted norms speed up the scoring process in Lucene. The actual query matching algo-rithms use functions that do very little computation at query matching time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Applications: One of the reasons for Lucene’s immense popularity is the ease of availability of Lucene applications for handling various document collections and 25See http://lucene.apache.org/solr/1044 Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search deployment systems for indexing large unstructured document collections.

      "27.6  Evaluation Measures of Search Relevance Without proper evaluation techniques, one cannot compare and measure the rele- vance of different retrieval models and IR systems in order to make improvements. Evaluation techniques of IR systems measure the topical relevance  and user rele- vance . Topical relevance  measures the extent to which the topic of a result matches the topic of the query.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mapping one’s information need with “perfect” queries is a cognitive task, and many users are not able to effectively form queries that would retrieve results more suited to their information need. Also, since a major chunk of user queries are informational in nature, there is no fixed set of right answers to show to the user. User relevance  is a term used to describe the “goodness” of a retrieved result with regard to the user’s information need.\n",
      "\n",
      "User relevance includes other implicit factors, such as user perception, context, timeliness, the user’s envi-ronment, and current task needs. Evaluating user relevance may also involve sub-jective analysis and study of user retrieval tasks to capture some of the properties of implicit factors involved in accounting for users’ bias for judging performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Web information retrieval, no binary classification decision is made on whether a document is relevant or nonrelevant to a query (whereas the Boolean (or binary) retrieval model uses this scheme, as we discussed in Section 27.2.1). Instead, a rank-ing of the documents is produced for the user. Therefore, some evaluation mea-sures focus on comparing different rankings produced by IR systems. We discuss some of these measures next.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.6.1 Recall and Precision Recall and precision metrics are based on the binary relevance assumption (whether each document is relevant or nonrelevant to the query). Recall  is defined as the num- ber of relevant documents retrieved by a search divided by the total number of actu-ally relevant documents existing in the database. Precision  is defined as the number of relevant documents retrieved by a search divided by the total number of docu-ments retrieved by that search.\n",

      "Using the term hits for the documents that truly or “correctly” match the user request, we can define recall  and precision as follows: Recall = |Hits|/|Relevant| Precision = |Hits|/|Retrieved| Recall and precision can also be defined in a ranked retrieval setting. Let us assume that there is one document at each rank position.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recall at rank position i for document d iq (denoted by r(i)) (diq is the retrieved document at position i for query q) is the fraction of relevant documents from d1q to diq in the result set for the query.

Moreover, search engines must regularly update their indexes given the dynamic nature of the Web as new Web sites are created and current ones are updated or deleted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since there are many millions of pages available on the Web on different topics, search engines must apply many sophisticated techniques such as link analysis to identify the importance of pages. There are other types of search engines besides the ones that regularly crawl the Web and create automatic indexes: these are human-powered, vertical search engines or metasearch engines. These search engines are developed with the help of computer-assisted systems to aid the curators with the process of assigning indexes.\n",

Application of data analysis techniques for discovery and analysis of useful information from the Web is known as Web analysis .\n",

The Web mining and analysis field is an integration of a wide range of fields spanning information retrieval, text analysis, natural language processing, data mining, machine learn-ing, and statistical analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goals of Web analysis are to improve and personalize search results relevance and to identify trends that may be of value to various businesses and organizations. We elaborate on these goals next. ■Finding relevant information. People usually search for specific informa- tion on the Web by entering keywords in a search engine or browsing infor- mation portals and using services. Search services are heavily constrained by search relevance problems since search engines must map and approximate the information need of millions of users as an a priori  task.\n",

      "Low precision (see Section 27.6) ensues due to results that are nonrelevant to the user. In the case of the Web, high recall  (see Section 27.6) is impossible to determine due to the inability to index all the pages on the Web. Also, measuring recall does not make sense since the user is concerned with only the top few docu-ments. The most relevant results for the user are typically from only the top few results. ■Personalization of the information.\n",

Social scientists are studying social capital and how to harness this rich resource to benefit society in various ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "We briefly touch upon aspects of social search in Section 27.8.2. Web analysis can be further classified into three categories: Web structure  analysis , which discovers knowledge from hyperlinks that represent the structure of the Web; Web content analysis , which deals with extracting useful information/knowledge from Web page contents; and Web usage analysis , which mines user access patterns from usage logs that record the activity of every user.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.7.2 Web Structure Analysis The World Wide Web is a huge corpus of information, but locating resources that are both high quality and relevant to the needs of the user is very difficult. The set of Web pages taken as a whole has almost no unifying structure, with variability in authoring style and content; this variability makes it difficult to precisely locate needed information. Index-based search engines have been one of the primary tools by which users search for information on the Web. Web search engines crawl the Web and create an index to the Web for searching purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a user spec-ifies her need for information by supplying keywords, these Web search engines query their repository of indexes and produce links or URLs with abbreviated con- tent as search results. There may be thousands of pages relevant to a particular query. A problem arises when only a few most relevant results are returned to the user. Our discussions of querying and relevance-based ranking in IR systems in (see Sections 27.2 and 27.3) is applicable to Web search engines. These ranking algo-rithms explore the link structure of the Web.\n",
      "\n",
      "Web pages, unlike standard text collections, contain connections to other Web pages or documents (via the use of hyperlinks), allowing users to browse from page to page. A hyperlink  has two components: a destination page  and an anchor text that describes the link. For example, a person can link to the Yahoo Web site on her 1050 Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search Web page with anchor text such as “My favorite Web site.” Anchor texts can be thought of as being implicit endorsements. They provide important latent human annotation.\n",
      "\n",
      "A person linking to other Web pages from her Web page is assumed to have some relation to those Web pages. Web search engines aim to distill results per their relevance and authority. There are many redundant hyperlinks, like the links to the homepage on every Web page of the Web site. Such hyperlinks must be eliminated from the search results by the search engines. A hub is a Web page or a Web site that links to a collection of prominent sites (authorities) on a common topic.\n",

Web structure analysis focuses on the inner structure of documents and deals with the link structure using hyperlinks at the interdocu- ment level. The structure and content of Web pages are often combined for infor-mation retrieval by Web search engines. Given a collection of interconnected Web documents, interesting and informative facts describing their connectivity in the Web subset can be discovered.\n",

      "Web structure analysis is also used to help with nav-igation and make it possible to compare/integrate different Web page schemes. This aspect of Web structure analysis facilitates Web document classification and clustering on the basis of structure. The PageRank  Ranking Algorithm. As discussed earlier, ranking algorithms are used to order search results based on relevance and authority. Google uses the well-known PageRank  algorithm, 28 which is based on the “importance” of each page.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every Web page has a number of forward links (out-edges) and backlinks (in-edges). It is very difficult to determine all the backlinks of a Web page, whereas it is relatively straightforward to determine its forward links. According to the PageRank algorithm, highly linked pages are more important (have greater authority) than pages with fewer links. However, not all backlinks are important. A backlink to a page from a credible source is more important than a link from some arbitrary page.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus a page has a high rank if the sum of the ranks of its backlinks is high. PageRank was an attempt to see how good an approximation of the “importance” of a page can be obtained from the link structure. The computation of page ranking follows an iterative approach. PageRank of a Web page is calculated as a sum of the PageRanks of all its backlinks. PageRank treats the Web like a Markov model . An imaginary Web surfer visits an infinite string of pages by clicking randomly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The PageRank of a page is an estimate of how often the surfer winds 28The PageRank algorithm was proposed by Lawrence Page (1998) and Sergey Brin, founders of Google. For more information, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank 27.7 Web Search and Analysis  1051 up at a particular page. PageRank is a measure of the query-independent importance of a page/node.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, let P(X) be the PageRank of any page X and C(X) be the number of outgoing links from page X, and let d be the damping factor in the range 0 < d < 1. Usually d is set to 0.85.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then PageRank for a page A can be calculated as: P(A) = (1 − d) + d(P(T1)/C(T1) + P(T 2)/C(T 2)+… + P(Tn)/C(Tn)) Here T1, T2, … , Tn are the pages that point to Page A (that is, are citations to page  A). PageRank forms a probability distribution over Web pages, so the sum of all Web pages’ PageRanks is one. The HITS  Ranking Algorithm.\n",
      "\n",
      "The HITS 29 algorithm proposed by Jon Kleinberg is another type of ranking algorithm exploiting the link structure of the Web. The algorithm presumes that a good hub is a document that points to many hubs, and a good authority is a document that is pointed at by many other authorities. The algorithm contains two main steps: a sampling component and a weight-propaga tion component. The sampling component constructs a focused collection S of pages with the following properties: 1. S is relatively small. 2. S is rich in relevant pages. 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "S contains most (or a majority) of the strongest authorities. The weight component recursively calculates the hub and authority values for each document as follows: 1. Initialize hub and authority values for all pages in S by setting them to 1. 2. While (hub and authority values do not converge): a. For each page in S, calculate authority value = Sum of hub values of all pages pointing to  the current page. b. For each page in S, calculate hub value = Sum of authority values of all pages pointed at  by the current page.\n",

      "27.7.4 Web Content Analysis As mentioned earlier, Web content analysis  refers to the process of discovering use- ful information from Web content/data/documents. The Web content data  consists of unstructured data such as free text from electronically stored documents, semi-structured data typically found as HTML documents with embedded image data, and more structured data such as tabular data and pages in HTML, XML, or other markup languages generated as output from databases.\n",
      "\n",
      "More generally, the term Web content  refers to any real data in the Web page that is intended for the user accessing that page. This usually consists of but is not limited to text and graphics. 29See Kleinberg (1999).1052 Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search We will first discuss some preliminary Web content analysis tasks and then look at the traditional analysis tasks of Web page classification and clustering. Structured Data Extraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Structured data on the Web is often very important because it represents essential information, such as a structured table showing the airline flight schedule between two cities. There are several approaches to struc-tured data extraction. One includes writing a wrapper , or a program that looks for different structural characteristics of the information on the page and extracts the right content. Another approach is to manually write an extraction program for each Web site based on observed format patterns of the site, which is very labor intensive and time consuming. This latter approach does not scale to a large num-ber of sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "A third approach is wrapper induction  or wrapper learning , where the user first manually labels a set of training set pages and the learning system gener-ates rules—based on the learning pages—that are applied to extract target items from other Web pages. A fourth approach is the automatic approach, which aims to find patterns/grammars from the Web pages and then uses wrapper generation  to produce a wrapper to extract data automatically. Web Information Integration. The Web is immense and has billions of docu- ments, authored by many different persons and organizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of this, Web pages that contain similar information may have different syntax and different words that describe the same concepts. This creates the need for integrating infor-mation from diverse Web pages. Two popular approaches for Web information integration are: 1. Web query interface integration , to enable querying multiple Web data- bases that are not visible in external interfaces and are hidden in the “deep Web.” The deep Web30 consists of those pages that do not exist until they are created dynamically as the result of a specific database search, which produces some of the information in the page (see Chapter 11).\n",
      "\n",
      "Since tradi- tional search engine crawlers cannot probe and collect information from such pages, the deep Web has heretofore been hidden from crawlers. 2. Schema matching , such as integrating directories and catalogs to come up with a global schema for applications. An example of such an application would be to match and combine into one record data from various sources by cross-linking health records from multiple systems. The result would be an individual global health record. These approaches remain an area of active research, and a detailed discussion of them is beyond the scope of this text.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consult the Selected Bibliography at the end of this chapter for further details. Ontology-Based Information Integration. This task involves using ontologies to effectively combine information from multiple heterogeneous sources. Ontologies—formal models of representation with explicitly defined concepts and named 30The deep Web as defined by Bergman (2001). 27.7 Web Search and Analysis  1053 relationships linking them—are used to address the issues of semantic heterogene- ity in data sources. Different classes of approaches are used for information integra-tion using ontologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Single ontology approaches  use one global ontology that provides a shared vocabulary for the specification of the semantics. They work if all informa-tion sources to be integrated provide nearly the same view on a domain of knowledge. For example, UMLS (described in Section 27.4.3) can serve as a common ontology for biomedical applications. ■In a multiple ontology approach , each information source is described by its own ontology.\n",
      "\n",
      "In principle, the “source ontology” can be a combination of several other ontologies, but it cannot be assumed that the different “source ontologies” share the same vocabulary. Dealing with multiple, par-tially overlapping, and potentially conflicting ontologies is a difficult prob-lem faced by many applications, including those in bioinformatics and other complex topics of study. Building Concept Hierarchies. One common way of organizing search results is via a linear ranked list of documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for some users and applications, a better way to display results would be to create groupings of related documents in the search result. One way of organizing documents in a search result, and for organiz-ing information in general, is by creating a concept hierarchy . The documents in a search result are organized into groups in a hierarchical fashion. Other related tech-niques to organize docments are through classification  and clustering  (see Chap- ter 28). Clustering creates groups of documents, where the documents in each group share many common concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segmenting Web Pages and Detecting Noise. There are many superfluous parts in a Web document, such as advertisements and navigation panels. The infor-mation and text in these superfluous parts should be eliminated as noise before classifying the documents based on their content. Hence, before applying classifica-tion or clustering algorithms to a set of documents, the areas or blocks of the docu-ments that contain noise should be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.7.5 Approaches to Web Content Analysis The two main approaches to Web content analysis are (1) agent based (IR view) and (2) database based (DB view). The agent-based approach  involves the development of sophisticated artificial intelligence systems that can act autonomously or semi-autonomously on behalf of a particular user, to discover and process Web-based information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, the agent-based Web analysis systems can be placed into the follow- ing three categories: ■Intelligent Web agents  are software agents that search for relevant infor- mation using characteristics of a particular application domain (and possi- bly a user profile) to organize and interpret the discovered information. For 1054 Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search example, an intelligent agent retrieves product information from a variety of vendor sites using only general information about the product domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Information filtering/categorization  is another technique that utilizes Web agents for categorizing Web documents. These Web agents use meth-ods from information retrieval, as well as semantic information based on the links among various documents, to organize documents into a concept hierarchy. ■Personalized Web agents  are another type of Web agents that utilize the personal preferences of users to organize search results, or to discover infor-mation and documents that could be of value for a particular user.\n",
      "\n",
      "User preferences could be learned from previous user choices, or from other indi-viduals who are considered to have similar preferences to the user. The database-based approach  aims to infer the structure of the Web site or to transform a Web site to organize it as a database so that better information man-agement and querying on the Web become possible. This approach of Web con-tent analysis primarily tries to model the data on the Web and integrate it so that more sophisticated queries than keyword-based search can be performed.\n",
      "\n",
      "These could be achieved by finding the schema of Web documents or building a Web document warehouse, a Web knowledge base, or a virtual database. The database-based approach may use a model such as the Object Exchange Model (OEM), 31 which represents semistructured data by a labeled graph. The data in the OEM is viewed as a graph, with objects as the vertices and labels on the edges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each object is identified by an object identifier and a value that is either atomic—such as inte-ger, string, GIF image, or HTML document—or complex in the form of a set of object references. The main focus of the database-based approach has been with the use of multilevel databases and Web query systems. A multilevel database  at its lowest level is a database containing primitive semistructured information stored in various Web repositories, such as hypertext documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the higher levels, metadata or gener-alizations are extracted from lower levels and organized in structured collections such as relational or object-oriented databases. In a Web query system , informa- tion about the content and structure of Web documents is extracted and organized using database-like techniques. Query languages similar to SQL can then be used to search and query Web documents. These types of queries combine structural que- ries, based on the organization of hypertext documents, and content-based queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.7.6 Web Usage Analysis Web usage analysis  is the application of data analysis techniques to discover usage patterns from Web data, in order to understand and better serve the needs of Web-based applications. This activity does not directly contribute to information retrieval; but it is important for improving and enhancing users’ search experiences. 31See Kosala and Blockeel (2000).\n",
      "\n",
      "27.7 Web Search and Analysis  1055 Web usage data  describes the pattern of usage of Web pages, such as IP addresses, page references, and the date and time of accesses for a user, user group, or an application. Web usage analysis typically consists of three main phases: preprocess-ing, pattern discovery, and pattern analysis. 1. Preprocessing. Preprocessing converts the information collected about usage statistics and patterns into a form that can be utilized by the pattern discovery methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we use the term page view  to refer to pages viewed or visited by a user. There are several different types of preprocessing techniques available: /box4Usage preprocessing  analyzes the available collected data about usage patterns of users, applications, and groups of users. Because this data is often incomplete, the process is difficult. Data cleaning techniques are necessary to eliminate the impact of irrelevant items in the analysis result. Frequently, usage data is identified by an IP address and consists of click-ing streams that are collected at the server.\n",
      "\n",
      "Better data is available if a usage tracking process is installed at the client site. /box4Content preprocessing  is the process of converting text, image, scripts, and other content into a form that can be used by the usage analysis. Often, this process consists of performing content analysis such as classi-fication or clustering. The clustering or classification techniques can group usage information for similar types of Web pages, so that usage patterns can be discovered for specific classes of Web pages that describe particular topics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page views can also be classified according to their intended use, such as for sales or for discovery or for other uses. /box4Structure preprocessing  can be done by parsing and reformatting the information about hyperlinks and structure between viewed pages. One difficulty is that the site structure may be dynamic and may have to be constructed for each server session. 2. Pattern discovery. The techniques that are used in pattern discovery are based on methods from the fields of statistics, machine learning, pattern recognition, data analysis, data mining, and other similar areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "These techniques are adapted so they take into consideration the specific knowledge and characteristics of Web analysis. For example, in association rule discovery (see Section 28.2), the notion of a transaction for market-basket analysis considers the items to be unordered. But the order of accessing of Web pages is important, and so it should be considered in Web usage analysis. Hence, pattern discovery involves mining sequences of page views. In general, using Web usage data, the following types of data mining activities may be performed for pattern discovery. /box4Statistical analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Statistical techniques are the most common method of extracting knowledge about visitors to a Web site. By analyzing the ses- sion log, it is possible to apply statis tical measures such as mean, median, and frequency count to parameters such as pages viewed, viewing time per page, length of navigation paths between pages, and other parameters that are relevant to Web usage analysis.1056 Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search /box4Association rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of Web usage analysis, association rules refer to sets of pages that are accessed together with a support value exceeding some specified threshold. (See Section 28.2 on association rules.) These pages may not be directly connected to one another via hyperlinks. For example, association rule discovery may reveal a correla-tion between users who visited a page containing electronic products to those who visit a page about sporting equipment. /box4Clustering. In the Web usage domain, there are two kinds of interesting clusters to be discovered: usage clusters and page clusters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clustering of users  tends to establish groups of users exhibiting similar browsing pat- terns. Such knowledge is especially useful for inferring user demographics in order to perform market segmentation in e-commerce applications or provide personalized Web content to the users. Clustering of pages  is based on the content of the pages, and pages with similar contents are grouped together. This type of clustering can be utilized in Internet search engines and in tools that provide assistance to Web browsing. /box4Classification.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Web domain, one goal is to develop a profile of users belonging to a particular class or category. This requires extraction and selection of features that best describe the properties of a given class or category of users. For example, an interesting pattern that may be   discovered would be: 60% of users who placed an online order in / Product/Books are in the 18–25 age group and live in rented apartments. /box4Sequential patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "These kinds of patterns identify sequences of Web accesses, which may be used to predict the next set of Web pages to be accessed by a certain class of users. These patterns can be used by market- ers to produce targeted advertisements on Web pages. Another type of sequential pattern pertains to which items are typically purchased follow-ing the purchase of a particular item. For example, after purchasing a computer, a printer is often purchased. /box4Dependency modeling. Dependency modeling aims to determine and model significant dependencies among the various variables in the Web domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, one may be interested in building a model that rep-resents the various stages a visitor undergoes while shopping in an online store; this model would be based on user actions (e.g., being a casual visi-tor versus being a serious potential buyer). 3. Pattern analysis. The final step is to filter out those rules or patterns that are considered to be not of interest based on the discovered patterns. One common technique for pattern analysis is to use a query language such as SQL to detect various patterns and relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another technique involves loading usage data into a data warehouse with ETL tools and per-forming OLAP operations to view the data along multiple dimensions (see Section 29.3). It is common to use visualization techniques, such as graph-ing patterns or assigning colors to different values, to highlight patterns or trends in the data. 27.8 Trends in Information Retrieval  1057\n",
      "\n",
      "27.7.7 Practical Applications of Web Analysis Web Analytics. The goal of web analytics  is to understand and optimize the per- formance of Web usage. This requires collecting, analyzing, and monitoring the performance of Internet usage data. On-site Web analytics measures the perfor-mance of a Web site in a commercial context. This data is typically compared against key performance indicators to measure effectiveness or performance of the Web site as a whole, and it can be used to improve a Web site or improve the mar-keting strategies.\n",

      "Web Spamming. It has become increasingly important for companies and indi- viduals to have their Web sites/Web pages appear in the top search results. To achieve this, it is essential to understand search engine ranking algorithms and to present the information in one’s page in such a way that the page is ranked high when the respective keywords are queried. There is a thin line separating legitimate page optimization for business purposes and spamming. Web spamming  is thus defined as a deliberate activity to promote one’s page by manipulating the results returned by the search engines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Web analysis may be used to detect such pages and discard them from search results. Web Security. Web analysis can be used to find interesting usage patterns of Web sites. If any flaw in a Web site has been exploited, it can be inferred using Web analysis, thereby allowing the design of more robust Web sites. For example, the backdoor or information leak of Web servers can be detected by using Web analysis techniques on abnormal Web application log data. Security analysis techniques such as intrusion detection and denial-of-service attacks are based on Web access pattern analysis.\n",

      "Web Crawlers. These are programs that visit Web pages and create copies of all the visited pages so they can be processed by a search engine for indexing the down-loaded pages and providing fast searches. Another use of crawlers is to automati-cally check and maintain Web sites. For example, the HTML code and the links in a Web site can be checked and validated by the crawler. Another unfortunate use of crawlers is to collect e-mail addresses and other personal information from Web pages; the information is subsequently used in sending spam e-mails.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.8 Trends in Information Retrieval   In this section, we review a few concepts that are being considered in recent research work in information retrieval.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.8.1 Faceted Search Faceted search is a technique that allows for an integrated search and navigation experience by allowing users to explore by filtering available information. This search technique is often used in ecommerce Web sites and applications and 1058 Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search enables users to navigate a multi-dimensional information space. Facets are gener- ally used for handling three or more dimensions of classification. These multiple dimensions of classification allow the faceted classification scheme  to classify an object in various ways based on different taxonomical criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, a Web page may be classified in various ways: by content (airlines, music, news, etc. ); by use (sales, information, registration, etc. ); by location; by language used (HTML, XML, etc. ); and in other ways or facets. Hence, the object can be classified in mul-tiple ways based on multiple taxonomies. A facet  defines properties or characteristics of a class of objects. The properties should be mutually exclusive and exhaustive.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, a collection of art objects might be classified using an artist facet (name of artist), an era facet (when the art was created), a type facet (painting, sculpture, mural, etc. ), a country of origin facet, a media facet (oil, watercolor, stone, metal, mixed media, etc. ), a collection facet (where the art resides), and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Faceted search uses faceted classification, which enables a user to navigate informa- tion along multiple paths corresponding to different orderings of the facets. This contrasts with traditional taxonomies, in which the hierarchy of categories is fixed and unchanging. University of California–Berkeley’s Flamenco project 32 is one of the earlier examples of a faceted search system. Most e-commerce sites today, such as Amazon or Expedia, use faceted search in their search interfaces to quickly com- pare and navigate various aspects related to search criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.8.2 Social Search The traditional view of Web navigation and browsing assumes that a single user is searching for information. This view contrasts with previous research by library scientists who studied users’ information-seeking habits. This research demon-strated that additional individuals may be valuable information resources during information search by a single user. More recently, research indicates that there is often direct user cooperation during Web-based information search. Some studies report that significant segments of the user population are engaged in explicit col-laboration on joint search tasks on the Web.\n",
      "\n",
      "Active collaboration by multiple par-ties also occurs in certain cases (for example, enterprise settings); at other times, and perhaps for a majority of searches, users often interact with others remotely, asynchronously, and even involuntarily and implicitly. Socially enabled online information search (social search) is a new phenomenon facilitated by recent Web technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collaborative social search  involves different ways for active involvement in search-related activities such as co-located search, remote collaboration on search tasks, use of social network for search, use of exper tise networks, use of social data mining or collective intelligence to improve the search process, and use of social interactions to facilitate information seeking and sense making. This social search activity may be done synchronously, asynchronously, 32Y ee (2003) describes faceted metadata for image search.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.8 Trends in Information Retrieval  1059 co-located, or in remote shared workspaces. Social psychologists have experimen- tally validated that the act of social discussions has facilitated cognitive performance. People in social groups can provide solutions (answers to questions), pointers to databases or to other people (meta-knowledge), and validation and legitimization of ideas; in addition, social groups can serve as memory aids and can help with problem reformulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guided participation  is a process in which people co-construct knowledge in concert with peers in their community. Information seeking is mostly a solitary activity on the Web today. Some recent work on collaborative search reports several interesting findings and the potential of this technology for better information access. It is increasingly common for people to use social networks such as Facebook to seek opinions and clarifications on various topics and to read prod-uct reviews before making a purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.8.3 Conversational Information Access Conversational information access  is an interactive and collaborative informa- tion-finding interaction. The participants engage in a natural human-to-human conversation, and intelligent agents listen to the conversation in the background and perform intent extraction  to provide participants with need-specific informa- tion. Agents use direct or subtle interactions with participants via mobile or wear-able communication devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "These interactions require technologies like speaker identification, keyword spotting, automatic speech recognition, semantic under-standing of conversations, and discourse analysis as a means of providing users with faster and relevant pointers for conversations. Via technologies like those just mentioned, information access is transformed from a solitary activity to a partici-patory activity. In addition, information access becomes more goal specific as agents use multiple technologies to gather relevant information and as participants provide conversational feedback to agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "27.8.4 Probabilistic Topic Modeling The unprecedented growth in information generated with the advent of the Web has led to issues concerning how to organize data into categories that will facilitate correct and efficient dissemination of information. For example, international news agencies like Reuters and the Associated Press gather daily news worldwide per-taining to business, sports, politics, technology, and so on. It is a tremendous chal-lenge to organize effectively this plethora of information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Search engines have conventionally organized words within and links among documents to make them accessible on the Web. Organizing information according to the topics and themes of documents allows users to navigate through the vast amount of information based on the topics they are interested in. To address this problem, a class of machine learning algorithms known as probabilistic topic models  has emerged in the last decade. These algorithms can automatically organize large collections of documents into relevant themes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beauty of these algorithms is that they are totally unsupervised, meaning that they 1060 Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search do not need any training sets or human annotations to perform this thematic extrapolation. The concept of this class of algorithms is as follows: Every document is inherently organized thematically. For example, documents about Barack Obama may mention other presidents, other issues related to the government, or a particu lar political theme.\n",
      "\n",
      "An article about one of the Iron Man  movies may contain refer- ences to other sci-fi (science fiction) characters from the Marvel series or generally have a sci-fi theme. These inherent structures in documents can be extracted by probabilistic modeling and estimation methods. As another example, let us assume that every document is made up of a collection of different topics in differing pro-portions (e.g., a document about politics may also be about presidents and Ameri-can history). Also, every topic is made up of a collection of words.\n",
      "\n",
      "By considering Figure 27.6, we can guess that document D, which mentions U.S. Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, can belong to the topics Presidents, Politics, Democrats, Republicans, and Government. In general, topics share a fixed vocabulary of words. This vocabulary of words is extracted from the collection of documents for which we wish to train the topic models. We generally choose the number of topics we wish to extract from the collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every topic ranks words differently according to how often a word is represented under a certain topic in different documents. In Figure 27.6, the bars representing topic proportions should all sum to 1. Document D primarily belongs to the topic Presidents, as shown in the bar graph. Figure 27.6 depicts the topics related to Presidents along with the list of words associated with this topic. Probabilistic topic modeling estimates topic distributions using a learning algo- rithm that assumes that documents can be generated as a mixture of topic propor-tions.\n",

      "These topic proportion estimates are computed using sampling and expectation maximization algorithms. An algorithm called latent Dirichlet alloca-tion (LDA) 33 is used to generate the topic models.

Types of Questions: In question answering systems, it is important to know the category or type of question, because answering strategies rely heavily on the type of questions. Some of these categories are not always mutually exclusive and hence require hybrid answering strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, questions can be categorized into the following types: Factoid Questions:  This type of question pinpoints the right phrase in a docu- ment or a database that correctly addresses the question. Examples of this type include questions such as, “Who is the president of the United States?”, “In which city was Elvis Presley born?”, ‘Where is Hartsfield Jackson International Airport located?’, and “At what time will today’s sunset occur?”.\n",
      "\n",
      "List Questions:  This type of question seeks a list of factoid responses that sat- isfy a given criterion. Examples include “Name three plays that were written by Shakespeare”, “Name the male actors who played the role of James Bond in the James Bond 007 movie series”, and “List three red-colored vegetables”. 34S. Kotz, N. Balakrishnan, and N. L. Johnson (2000). 35German and German (1984).\n",
      "\n",
      "36See Ferrucci et al. (2010).1062 Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search Definition Questions:  This type of question asks about the definition and meaning of the concept, and to extract the essential information and properties of the concept. Examples include “What is an inert gas ?”, “Who is Alexander the Great?”, and “What is the LIBOR rate?”. Opinion Questions:  This type of question seeks different views on a subject that the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, “What countries should be allowed to test nuclear weapons?” and “What is the sentiment in Saudi Arabia about terrorism in the Middle East?” In recent years, joint initiatives in research and academia have advocated adopting common metrics, architectures, tools, and methodologies to create baselines that will facilitate and improve the QA technique. Architectures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most state-of-the-art QA architectures are generally made up of pipelines that comprise the following stages: Question Analysis:  This stage involves analyzing questions and converting them to structural representations of analyzed text for processing by down-stream components. Answer types are extracted from parsed representations of questions using some or all of the following techniques: shallow semantic pars-ing, focus detection, answer type classification, named entity recognition, and co-reference resolution. /box4Shallow semantic parsing: The process of assigning surface-level markups to sentence structures via supervised machine learning methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, frames are automatically instantiated for sentences by trying to match “WHO did WHAT to WHOM, WHEN, WHERE, WHY , and HOW” elements. /box4Focus detection: In an image, certain things stand out whereas others remain in the background. We say that things that stand out are in focus. Similarly, in QA, questions have focus words that contain references to answers.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in the question “Which book of Shakespeare is a tragedy about lovers?” , the focus words “book of Shakespeare” can be instantiated with the rule “which X” , where X is a noun phrase in a sen-tence. QA systems use focus words to trigger directed searches and to aid in answer resolution. /box4Answer type classification: This phase helps determine the categories of answers in QA. In the preceding example, the headword of the focus words, “book” , is the answer type for this question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several machine learning tech-niques are applied in QA to determine the answer type of a question. /box4Named entity recognition: Named entity recognition seeks to classify ele- ments in text into predefined categories, such as person, place, animal, country, river, continent. /box4Co-reference resolution: The task of co-reference resolution is about identifying multiple expressions in text that refer to the same thing. For example, in the sentence “John said that he wanted to go to the theater on Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "” , the pronoun “he” refers to “John” and is a co-reference in text. 27.9 Summary  1063 Query Generation:  In this stage, the analyzed text is used to generate multiple queries using query normalization and expansion techniques for one or more underlying search engines in which the answers may be embedded.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in the question, “Which book of Shakespeare is about tragedy of lovers?”, the expanded queries can be “Shakespeare love story”, “novels of Shakespeare”, “tragic love story author Shakespeare”, “love story genre tragedy author Shakespeare”, and so on. Extracted keywords, answer types, synonyms information, and named entities are generally used in different combinations to create different queries. Search:  In this stage, the queries are sent to different search engines and rele- vant passages are retrieved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Search engines where searches are performed can be online, such as Google or bing, and offline, such as Lucene or Indri. 37 Candidate Answer Generation:  Named entity extractors are used on retrieved passages and matched against desired answer types to come up with candidate answers. Depending on the desired granularity of the answer, candidate gen-eration and answer type matching algorithms are applied (e.g., surface pattern matching and structural matching).\n",
      "\n",
      "In surface pattern matching, regular expression templates are instantiated with arguments from the question and matched against lexical chunks of retrieved passages to extract answers. For example, focus words are aligned with passages containing potential answers to extract answer candidates. In the sentence, “Romeo and Juliet is a tragic love story by Shakespeare”, the phrase “Romeo and Juliet” can simply replace “Which book” in the question, “Which book is a tragic love story by Shake-speare?”.\n",
      "\n",
      "In structural matching, questions and retrieved passages are parsed and aligned together using syntactic and semantic alignment to find answer candidates. A sentence such as, “Shakespeare wrote the tragic love story Romeo and Juliet” cannot be surface matched with the aforementioned question, but with correct parsing and alignment will structurally match with the question. Answer Scoring:  In this stage, confidence scores for the candidate answers are estimated. Similar answers are merged; knowledge sources can be reused to gather supporting evidence for different candidate answers.\n",

      "27.9 Summary   In this chapter, we covered an important area called information retrieval (IR) that is closely related to databases. With the advent of the Web, unstructured data with text, images, audio, and video is proliferating at phenomenal rates. Although data-base management systems have a very good handle on structured data, the unstruc-tured data containing a variety of data types is being stored mainly on ad hoc information repositories on the Web that are available for consumption primarily via IR systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Google, Yahoo, and similar search engines are IR systems that make the advances in this field readily available for the average end user and give end users a richer and continually improving search experience. 37http://www.lemurproject.org/indri/1064 Chapter 27 Introduction to Information Retrieval and Web Search We started in Section 27.1 by first introducing the field of IR in section 27.1.1 and comparing IR and database technologies in Section 27.1.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "A brief history of IR was presented in Section 27.1.3, and the query and browsing modes of interaction in IR systems were introduced in Section 27.1.4. We presented in Section 27.2 the various retrieval models used in IR, including Boolean, vector space, probabilistic, and semantic models. These models allow us to measure whether a document is relevant to a user query and provide similarity measurement heuristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Section 27.3 we presented different types of queries—in addition to keyword-based queries, which dominate, there are other types, includ-ing Boolean, phrase, proximity, natural language, and others for which explicit sup-port needs to be provided by the retrieval model. Text preprocessing is important in IR systems, and we discussed in Section 27.4 various activities like stopword removal, stemming, and the use of thesauruses.\n",
      "\n",
      "We then discussed the construction and use of inverted indexes in Section 27.5, which are at the core of IR systems and contribute to factors involving search efficiency. We then discussed in Section 27.6 various evaluation metrics, such as recall precision and F-score, to measure the goodness of the results of IR queries. The Lucene open source indexing and search engine and its extension called Solr was discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relevance feedback was briefly addressed—it is important to modify and improve the retrieval of pertinent infor-mation for the user through his interaction and engagement in the search process. We provided in Section 27.7 a somewhat detailed introduction to analysis of the Web as it relates to information retrieval. We divided this treatment into the analysis of content, structure, and usage of the Web.\n",
      "\n",
      "Web search was discussed, including an analysis of the Web link structure (Section 27.7.3), including an introduction to algo-rithms for ranking the results from a Web search such as PageRank and HITS. Finally, we briefly discussed current trends, including faceted search, social search, and con-versational search. We also presented probabilistic modeling of topics of documents and a popular technique called latent Dirichlet allocation.\n",

      "In reports such as the popular Gartner Report,1 data mining has been hailed as one of the top technologies for the near future. In this section, we relate data mining to the broader area called knowledge discovery  and contrast the two by means of an illustrative example.\n",
      "\n",
      "28.1.1 Data Mining versus Data Warehousing The goal of a data warehouse (see Chapter 29) is to support decision making with data. Data mining can be used in conjunction with a data warehouse to help with certain types of decisions. Data mining can be applied to operational databases with individual transactions. To make data mining more efficient, the data warehouse should have an aggregated or summarized collection of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data mining helps in extracting meaningful new patterns that cannot necessarily be found by merely querying or processing data or meta-data in the data warehouse. Therefore, data mining applications should be strongly considered early, during the design of a data warehouse. Also, data mining tools should be designed to facilitate their use in con-junction with data warehouses. In fact, for very large databases running into tera-bytes and even petabytes of data, successful use of data mining applications will depend first on the construction of a data warehouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "28.1.2  Data Mining as a Part of the Knowledge Discovery Process Knowledge discovery in databases , frequently abbreviated as KDD , typically encompasses more than data mining. The knowledge discovery process comprises six phases: 2 data selection, data cleansing, enrichment, data transformation or encoding, data mining, and the reporting and display of the discovered information. As an example, consider a transaction database maintained by a specialty consumer goods retailer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose the client data includes a customer name, zip code, phone number, date of purchase, item code, price, quantity, and total amount. A variety of new knowledge can be discovered by KDD processing on this client database. Dur-ing data selection , data about specific items or categories of items, or from stores in a specific region or area of the country, may be selected. The data cleansing  process then may correct invalid zip codes or eliminate records with incorrect phone pre-fixes. Enrichment  typically enhances the data with additional sources of informa- tion.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, given the client names and phone numbers, the store may purchase other data about age, income, and credit rating and append them to each record. Data transformation  and encoding may be done to reduce the amount of 1The Gartner Report is one example of the many technology survey publications that corporate managers rely on to discuss and select data mining technology. 2This discussion is largely based on Adriaans and Zantinge (1996). 28.1 Overview of Data Mining Technology  1071 data.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, item codes may be grouped in terms of product categories into audio, video, supplies, electronic gadgets, camera,4 accessories, and so on. Zip codes may be aggregated into geographic regions, incomes may be divided into ranges, and so on. In Figure 29.1, we will show a process called extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) as a precursor to the data warehouse creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "If data mining is based on an existing warehouse for this retail store chain, we would expect that the cleaning has already been applied. It is only after such preprocessing that data min- ing techniques are used to mine different rules and patterns. The result of mining may be to discover the following types of new information: ■Association rules —for example, whenever a customer buys video equip- ment, he or she also buys another electronic gadget.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Sequential patterns —for example, suppose a customer buys a camera, and within three months he or she buys photographic supplies, then within six months he is likely to buy an accessory item. This defines a sequential pattern of transactions. A customer who buys more than twice in lean periods may be likely to buy at least once during the December holiday shopping period.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Classification trees —for example, customers may be classified by frequency of visits, types of financing used, amount of purchase, or affinity for types of items; some revealing statistics may be generated for such classes. As this retail store example shows, data mining must be preceded by significant data preparation before it can yield useful information that can directly influence business decisions. The results of data mining may be reported in a variety of formats, such as listings, graphic outputs, summary tables, and visualizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "28.1.3 Goals of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Data mining is typically carried out with some end goals or applications. Broadly speaking, these goals fall into the following classes: prediction, identification, clas-sification, and optimization. ■Prediction. Data mining can show how certain attributes within the data will behave in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of predictive data mining include the analysis of buying transactions to predict what consumers will buy under certain discounts, how much sales volume a store will generate in a given period, and whether deleting a product line will yield more profits. In such applications, business logic is used coupled with data mining. In a scientific context, certain seismic wave patterns may predict an earthquake with high probability. ■Identification. Data patterns can be used to identify the existence of an item, an event, or an activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, intruders trying to break a sys- tem may be identified by the programs executed, files accessed, and CPU time per session. In biological applications, existence of a gene may be 1072 Chapter 28 Data Mining Concepts identified by certain sequences of nucleotide symbols in the DNA sequence. The area known as authentication  is a form of identification. It ascertains whether a user is indeed a specific user or one from an authorized class, and it involves comparing parameters or images or signals against a database. ■Classification.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data mining can partition the data so that different classes or categories can be identified based on combinations of parameters. For exam-ple, customers in a supermarket can be categorized into discount- seeking shoppers, shoppers in a rush, loyal regular shoppers, shoppers attached to name brands, and infrequent shoppers. This classification may be used in different analyses of customer buying transactions as a post–mining activity. Sometimes classification based on common domain knowledge is used as an input to decompose the mining problem and make it simpler.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, health foods, party foods, and school lunch foods are distinct categories in the supermarket business. It makes sense to analyze relationships within and across categories as separate problems. Such categorization may be used to encode the data appropriately before subjecting it to further data mining. ■Optimization. One eventual goal of data mining may be to optimize the use of limited resources such as time, space, money, or materials and to maxi- mize output variables such as sales or profits under a given set of constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "As such, this goal of data mining resembles the objective function used in operations research problems that deals with optimization under constraints. The term data mining  is popularly used in a broad sense. In some situations, it includes statistical analysis and constrained optimization as well as machine learn- ing. There is no sharp line separating data mining from these disciplines. It is beyond our scope, therefore, to discuss in detail the entire range of applications that make up this vast body of work.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a detailed understanding of the topic, readers are referred to specialized books devoted to data mining.\n",
      "\n",
      "28.1.4 Types of Knowledge Discovered during Data Mining The term knowledge  is broadly interpreted as involving some degree of intelligence. There is a progression from raw data to information to knowledge as we go through additional processing. Knowledge is often classified as inductive versus deductive. Deductive knowledge  deduces new information based on applying prespecified  logi- cal rules of deduction on the given data. Data mining addresses inductive knowledge , which discovers new rules and patterns from the supplied data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowledge can be represented in many forms: In an unstructured sense, it can be represented by rules or propositional logic. In a structured form, it may be represented in decision trees, semantic networks, neural networks, or hierarchies of classes or frames. It is common to describe the knowledge discovered during data mining as follows: ■Association rules. These rules correlate the presence of a set of items with another range of values for another set of variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples: (1) When a female retail shopper buys a handbag, she is likely to buy shoes. (2) An X-ray image containing characteristics a and b is likely to also exhibit characteristic c. 28.2 Association Rules  1073 ■Classification hierarchies. The goal is to work from an existing set of events or transactions to create a hierarchy of classes. Examples: (1) A population may be divided into five ranges of credit worthiness based on a history of previous credit transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) A model may be developed for the factors that determine the desirability of a store location on a 1–10 scale. (3) Mutual funds may be classified based on performance data using characteristics such as growth, income, and stability. ■Sequential patterns. A sequence of actions or events is sought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example: If a patient underwent cardiac bypass surgery for blocked arteries and an aneurysm and later developed high blood urea within a year of surgery, he or she is likely to suffer from kidney failure within the next 18 months. Detecting sequential patterns is equivalent to detecting associations among events with certain temporal relationships. ■Patterns within time series. Similarities can be detected within positions of a time series  of data, which is a sequence of data taken at regular intervals, such as daily sales or daily closing stock prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples: (1) Stocks of a utility company, ABC Power, and a financial company, XYZ Securities, showed the same pattern during 2014 in terms of closing stock prices. (2) Two products show the same selling pattern in summer but a different one in winter. (3) A pattern in solar magnetic wind may be used to predict changes in Earth’s atmospheric conditions. ■Clustering. A given population of events or items can be partitioned (seg- mented) into sets of “similar” elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples: (1) An entire population of treatment data on a disease may be divided into groups based on the sim- ilarity of side effects produced. (2) The adult population in the United States may be categorized into five groups from most likely to buy  to least likely to buy a new product. (3) The Web accesses made by a collection of users against a set of documents (say, in a digital library) may be analyzed in terms of the keywords of documents to reveal clusters or categories of users.\n",
      "\n",
      "For most applications, the desired knowledge is a combination of the above types. We expand on each of the above knowledge types in the following sections.\n",
      "\n",
      "28.2 Association Rules\n",
      "\n",
      "28.2.1 Market-Basket Model, Support, and Confidence One of the major technologies in data mining involves the discovery of association rules. The database is regarded as a collection of transactions, each involving a set of items. A common example is that of market-basket data . Here the market basket corresponds to the sets of items a consumer buys in a supermarket during one visit. Consider four such transactions in a random sample shown in Figure 28.1.\n",
      "\n",
      "An association rule  is of the form X => Y, where X = {x1, x2, … , xn}, and Y = {y1, y2, … , ym} are sets of items, with xi and yj being distinct items for all i and all j. This 1074 Chapter 28 Data Mining Concepts association states that if a customer buys X, he or she is also likely to buy Y.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, any association rule has the form LHS (left-hand side) => RHS (right-hand side), where LHS and RHS are sets of items. The set LHS ∪ RHS is called an itemset , the set of items purchased by customers. For an association rule to be of interest to a data miner, the rule should satisfy some interest measure. Two common interest measures are support and confidence. The support  for a rule LHS => RHS is with respect to the itemset; it refers to how frequently a specific itemset occurs in the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is, the support is the per-centage of transactions that contain all of the items in the itemset LHS ∪ RHS. If the support is low, it implies that there is no overwhelming evidence that items in LHS ∪ RHS occur together because the itemset occurs in only a small fraction of transactions. Another term for support is prevalence  of the rule. The confidence  is with regard to the implication shown in the rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "The confidence of the rule LHS => RHS is computed as the support(LHS ∪ RHS)/support(LHS). We can think of it as the probability that the items in RHS will be purchased given that the items in LHS are purchased by a customer. Another term for confidence is strength  of the rule. As an example of support and confidence, consider the following two rules: milk => juice and bread => juice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at our four sample transactions in Figure 28.1, we see that the support of {milk, juice} is 50% and the support of {bread, juice} is only 25%. The confidence of milk => juice is 66.7% (meaning that, of three transactions in which milk occurs, two contain juice) and the confidence of bread => juice is 50% (meaning that one of two transactions containing bread also contains juice). As we can see, support and confidence do not necessarily go hand in hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of mining association rules, then, is to generate all possible rules that exceed some minimum user-specified support and confidence thresholds. The problem is thus decomposed into two subproblems: 1. Generate all itemsets that have a support that exceeds the threshold. These sets of items are called large  (or frequent ) itemsets . Note that large here means large support. 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "For each large itemset, all the rules that have a minimum confidence are generated as follows: For a large itemset X and Y ⊂ X, let Z = X − Y; then if support( X)/support( Z) > minimum confidence, the rule Z => Y (that is, X − Y => Y) is a valid rule. Generating rules by using all large itemsets and their supports is relatively straight- forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, discovering all large itemsets together with the value for their Transaction_id Time Items_bought 101 6:35 milk, bread, cookies, juice 792 7:38 milk, juice 1130 8:05 milk, eggs 1735 8:40 bread, cookies, coffeeFigure 28.1 Sample transactions in market-basket model.\n",
      "\n",
      "28.2 Association Rules  1075 support is a major problem if the cardinality of the set of items is very high. A typi- cal supermarket has thousands of items. The number of distinct itemsets is 2m, where m is the number of items, and counting support for all possible itemsets becomes very computation intensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "To reduce the combinatorial search space, algorithms for finding association rules utilize the following properties: ■A subset of a large itemset must also be large (that is, each subset of a large itemset exceeds the minimum required support). ■Conversely, a superset of a small itemset is also small (implying that it does not have enough support). The first property is referred to as downward closure . The second property, called the antimonotonicity  property, helps to reduce the search space of possible solu- tions.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is, once an itemset is found to be small (not a large itemset), then any extension to that itemset, formed by adding one or more items to the set, will also yield a small itemset.\n",
      "\n",
      "28.2.2 Apriori Algorithm The first algorithm to use the downward closure and antimontonicity properties was the apriori algorithm , shown as Algorithm 28.1. We illustrate Algorithm 28.1 using the transaction data in Figure 28.1 using a mini- mum support of 0.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "The candidate 1-itemsets are {milk, bread, juice, cookies, eggs, coffee} and their respective supports are 0.75, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.25. The first four items qualify for L 1 since each support is greater than or equal to 0.5. In the first iteration of the repeat-loop, we extend the frequent 1-itemsets to create the candidate frequent 2-itemsets, C 2.\n",

Several other algorithms have been proposed to mine association rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "They vary mainly in terms of how the candidate itemsets are generated and how the supports for the candidate itemsets are counted. Some algorithms use data structures such as bitmaps and hashtrees to keep information about itemsets. Several algorithms have been proposed that use multiple scans of the database because the potential number of itemsets, 2 m, can be too large to set up counters during a single scan.\n",

      "28.2.3 Sampling Algorithm The main idea for the sampling algorithm  is to select a small sample, one that fits in main memory, of the database of transactions and to determine the frequent itemsets from that sample. If those frequent itemsets form a superset of the frequent itemsets for the entire database, then we can determine the real frequent itemsets by scanning the remainder of the database in order to compute the exact support val-ues for the superset itemsets.\n",

Consider the case where a set X is not contained in the frequent itemsets. If all subsets of X are contained in the set of frequent itemsets, then X would be in the negative border. We illustrate this with the following example.\n",

The negative border is important since it is necessary to determine the support for those itemsets in the negative border to ensure that no large itemsets are missed from analyzing the sample data. Support for the negative border is determined when the remainder of the database is scanned.\n",

If we are given a database with a small number of potential large itemsets, say, a few thou-sand, then the support for all of them can be tested in one scan by using a partition-ing technique. Partitioning divides the database into nonoverlapping subsets; these are individually considered as separate databases and all large itemsets for that par-tition, called local frequent itemsets , are generated in one pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "The apriori algo- rithm can then be used efficiently on each partition if it fits entirely in main memory. Partitions are chosen in such a way that each partition can be accommo-dated in main memory. As such, a partition is read only once in each pass. The only caveat with the partition method is that the minimum support used for each parti-tion has a slightly different meaning from the original value. The minimum support is based on the size of the partition rather than the size of the database for deter-mining local frequent (large) itemsets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The actual support threshold value is the same as given earlier, but the support is computed only for a partition. At the end of pass one, we take the union of all frequent itemsets from each parti- tion. This forms the global candidate frequent itemsets for the entire database. When these lists are merged, they may contain some false positives. That is, some of the itemsets that are frequent (large) in one partition may not qualify in several other partitions and hence may not exceed the minimum support when the original database is considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that there are no false negatives; no large itemsets will be missed. The global candidate large itemsets identified in pass one are verified in pass two; that is, their actual support is measured for the entire  database. At the end of phase two, all global large itemsets are identified. The partition algorithm lends itself naturally to a parallel or distributed implementation for better efficiency. Fur-ther improvements to this algorithm have been suggested. 4\n",
      "\n",
      "28.2.6 Other Types of Association Rules Association Rules among Hierarchies. There are certain types of associations that are particularly interesting for a special reason. These associations occur among hierarchies of items. Typically, it is possible to divide items among disjoint hierar-chies based on the nature of the domain. For example, foods in a supermarket, items in a department store, or articles in a sports shop can be categorized into classes and subclasses that give rise to hierarchies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider Figure 28.3, which shows the taxonomy of items in a supermarket. The figure shows two hierarchies—beverages and desserts, respectively. The entire groups may not produce associa-tions of the form beverages => desserts, or desserts => beverages. However, associations of the type Healthy-brand frozen yogurt => bottled water, or Rich 3See Savasere et al.\n",

(1996) and Lin and Dunham (1998).1082 Chapter 28 Data Mining Concepts cream-brand ice cream => wine cooler may produce enough confidence and sup- port to be valid association rules of interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, if the application area has a natural classification of the itemsets into hierarchies, discovering associations within  the hierarchies is of no particular inter- est. The ones of specific interest are associations across  hierarchies. They may occur among item groupings at different levels. Multidimensional Associations. Discovering association rules involves search- ing for patterns in a file. In Figure 28.1, we have an example of a file of customer transactions with three dimensions: Transaction_id, Time, and Items_bought.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, our data mining tasks and algorithms introduced up to this point only involve one dimension: Items_bought. The following rule is an example of includ-ing the label of the single dimension: Items_bought(milk) => Items_bought(juice). It may be of interest to find association rules that involve multiple dimensions, for example, Time(6:30 … 8:00) => Items_bought(milk). Rules like these are called multidimensional association rules .\n",
      "\n",
      "The dimensions represent attributes of records of a file or, in terms of relations, columns of rows of a relation, and can be categori-cal or quantitative. Categorical attributes have a finite set of values that display no ordering relationship. Quantitative attributes are numeric and their values display an ordering relationship, for example, <. Items_bought is an example of a categori-cal attribute and Transaction_id and Time are quantitative. One approach to handling a quantitative attribute is to partition its values into non- overlapping intervals that are assigned labels.\n",
      "\n",
      "This can be done in a static manner based on domain-specific knowledge. For example, a concept hierarchy may group values for Salary  into three distinct classes: low income (0 < Salary  < 29,999), middle income (30,000 < Salary  < 74,999), and high income ( Salary  > 75,000). From here, the typical apriori-type algorithm or one of its variants can be used for the rule min-ing since the quantitative attributes now look like categorical attributes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another approach to partitioning is to group attribute values based on data distribution (for example, equi-depth partitioning) and to assign integer values to each partition. The partitioning at this stage may be relatively fine, that is, a larger number of inter-vals. Then during the mining process, these partitions may combine with other adjacent partitions if their support is less than some predefined maximum value. An apriori-type algorithm can be used here as well for the data mining. Negative Associations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem of discovering a negative association is harder than that of discovering a positive association. A negative association is of the following type: 60% of customers who buy potato chips do not buy bottled water . (Here, the 60% refers to the confidence for the negative association rule.) In a data- base with 10,000 items, there are 210,000 possible combinations of items, a majority of which do not appear even once in the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the absence of a certain item combination is taken to mean a negative association, then we potentially have mil-lions and millions of negative association rules with RHSs that are of no interest at all. The problem, then, is to find only interesting  negative rules. In general, we are interested in cases in which two specific sets of items appear very rarely in the same transaction. This poses two problems. 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a total item inventory of 10,000 items, the probability of any two being bought together is (1/10,000) * (1/10,000) = 10 –8. If we find the actual sup- port for these two occurring together to be zero, that does not represent a significant departure from expectation and hence is not an interesting (neg- ative) association. 2. The other problem is more serious.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are looking for item combinations with very low support, and there are millions and millions with low or even zero support. For example, a data set of 10 million transactions has most of the 2.5 billion pairwise combinations of 10,000 items missing. This would generate billions of useless rules. Therefore, to make negative association rules interesting, we must use prior knowl- edge about the itemsets. One approach is to use hierarchies. Suppose we use the hierarchies of soft drinks and chips shown in Figure 28.4.\n",

      "5 In the frozen yogurt and bottled water groupings shown in Figure 28.3, suppose the Reduce versus Healthy-brand division is 80–20 and the Plain and Clear brands division is 60–40 among respective categories. This would give a joint probability of Reduce frozen yogurt being purchased with Plain bottled water as 48% among the transactions containing a frozen yogurt and bottled water.\n",
      "\n",
      "If this support, however, is found to be only 20%, it would indicate a significant nega-tive association among Reduce yogurt and Plain bottled water; again, that would be interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem of finding negative association is important in the above situations given the domain knowledge in the form of item generalization hierarchies (that is, the beverage given and desserts hierarchies shown in Figure 28.3), the existing pos-itive associations (such as between the frozen yogurt and bottled water groups), and the distribution of items (such as the name brands within related groups). The scope of discovery of negative associations is limited in terms of knowing the item hierarchies and distributions. Exponential growth of negative associations remains a challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "28.2.7 Additional Considerations for Association Rules The mining of association rules in real-life databases is complicated by the following factors: ■The cardinality of itemsets in most situations is extremely large, and the vol- ume of transactions is very high as well. Some operational databases in retailing and communication industries collect tens of millions of transac-tions per day. ■Transactions show variability in such factors as geographic location and sea- sons, making sampling difficult. ■Item classifications exist along multiple dimensions.\n",

      "Hence, driving the dis- covery process with domain knowledge, particularly for negative rules, is extremely difficult. ■Quality of data is variable; significant problems exist with missing, errone- ous, conflicting, as well as redundant data in many industries. 5For simplicity we are assuming a uniform distribution of transactions among members of a hierarchy. 28.3 Classification  1085\n",

Hence this type of activity is also called supervised learning . Once the model is built, it can be used to classify new data.

However, it is often useful to partition data without having a training sample; this is also known as unsupervised learning . For example, in business, it may be important to determine groups of customers who have similar buying patterns, or in medicine, it may be important to determine groups of patients who show similar reactions to prescribed drugs.\n",

      "The goal of clustering is to place records into groups, such that records in a group are simi- lar to each other and dissimilar to records in other groups. The groups are usu- ally disjoint . An important facet of clustering is the similarity function that is used. When the data is numeric, a similarity function based on distance is typically used. For exam-ple, the Euclidean distance can be used to measure similarity. Consider two n-dimensional data points (records) r j and rk.\n",

      "Traditionally, clustering algorithms assume that the entire data set fits in main memory. More recently, researchers have developed algorithms that are efficient and are scalable for very large databases. One such algorithm is called BIRCH. BIRCH is a hybrid approach that uses both a hierarchical clustering approach, which builds a tree representation of the data, as well as additional clustering meth-ods, which are applied to the leaf nodes of the tree. Two input parameters are used by the BIRCH algorithm.\n",
      "\n",
      "One specifies the amount of available main memory and the other is an initial threshold for the radius of any cluster. Main memory is used to store descriptive cluster information such as the center (mean) of a cluster and the radius of the cluster (clusters are assumed to be spherical in shape). The radius threshold affects the number of clusters that are produced. For example, if the radius threshold value is large, then few clusters of many records will be formed. The algorithm tries to maintain the number of clusters such that their radius is below the radius threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "If available memory is insufficient, then the radius threshold is increased. The BIRCH algorithm reads the data records sequentially and inserts them into an in-memory tree structure, which tries to preserve the clustering structure of the data. The records are inserted into the appropriate leaf nodes (potential clusters) based on the distance between the record and the cluster center. The leaf node where the insertion happens may have to split, depending upon the updated center and radius of the cluster and the radius threshold parameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, when splitting, extra cluster information is stored, and if memory becomes insufficient, then the radius threshold will be increased. Increasing the radius threshold may actually produce a side effect of reducing the number of clusters since some nodes may be merged. Overall, BIRCH is an efficient clustering method with a linear computational com- plexity in terms of the number of records to be clustered. 28.5 Approaches to Other Data Mining Problems  1091\n",

      "28.5.1 Discovery of Sequential Patterns The discovery of sequential patterns is based on the concept of a sequence of item- sets. We assume that transactions such as the supermarket-basket transactions we discussed previously are ordered by time of purchase. That ordering yields a sequence of itemsets. For example, {milk, bread, juice}, {bread, eggs}, {cookies, milk, coffee} may be such a sequence of itemsets  based on three visits by the same customer to the store.\n",
      "\n",
      "The support  for a sequence S of itemsets is the percentage of the given set U of sequences of which S is a subsequence. In this example, {milk, bread, juice} {bread, eggs} and {bread, eggs} {cookies, milk, coffee} are considered subsequences . The problem of identifying sequential patterns, then, is to find all subsequences from the given sets of sequences that have a user-defined minimum support.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sequence S 1, S2, S3, … is a predictor  of the fact that a customer who buys itemset S1 is likely to buy itemset S2 and then S3, and so on. This prediction is based on the frequency (support) of this sequence in the past. Various algorithms have been investigated for sequence detection.\n",
      "\n",
      "28.5.2 Discovery of Patterns in Time Series Time series  are sequences of events; each event may be a given fixed type of a transaction. For example, the closing price of a stock or a fund is an event that occurs every weekday for each stock and fund. The sequence of these values per stock or fund constitutes a time series. For a time series, one may look for a variety of patterns by analyzing sequences and subsequences as we did above.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we might find the period during which the stock rose or held steady for n days, or we might find the longest period over which the stock had a fluctuation of no more than 1% over the previous closing price, or we might find the quarter during which the stock had the most percentage gain or percent-age loss. Time series may be compared by establishing measures of similarity to identify companies whose stocks behave in a similar fashion. Analysis and min-ing of time series is an extended functionality of temporal data management (see Chapter 26).\n",

      "28.5.3 Regression Regression  is a special application of the classification rule. If a classification rule is regarded as a function over the variables that maps these variables into a target class variable, the rule is called a regression rule . A general application of regres- sion occurs when, instead of mapping a tuple of data from a relation to a specific class, the value of a variable is predicted based on that tuple.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, consider a relation LAB_TESTS  (patient ID, test 1, test 2, … , test n)1092 Chapter 28 Data Mining Concepts which contains values that are results from a series of n tests for one patient. The target variable that we wish to predict is P, the probability of survival of the patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the rule for regression takes the form: (test 1 in range 1) and (test 2 in range 2) and … (test n in range n) ⇒ P = x, or x < P ≤ y The choice depends on whether we can predict a unique value of P or a range of values for P. If we regard P as a function: P = f (test 1, test 2, …, test n) the function is called a regression function  to predict P. In general, if the function appears as Y = f (X1, X2, … , Xn), and f is linear in the domain variables xi, the process of deriving f from a given set of tuples for < X1, X2, … , X n, y> is called linear regression .\n",

      "Linear regression is a com- monly used statistical technique for fitting a set of observations or points in n dimensions with the target variable y. Regression analysis is a very common tool for analysis of data in many research domains. The discovery of the function to predict the target variable is equivalent to a data mining operation.\n",

      "28.5.4 Neural Networks A neural network  is a technique derived from artificial intelligence research that uses generalized regression and provides an iterative method to carry it out. Neural networks use the curve-fitting approach to infer a function from a set of samples. This technique provides a learning approach ; it is driven by a test sample that is used for the initial inference and learning. With this kind of learning method, responses to new inputs may be able to be interpolated from the known samples.\n",
      "\n",
      "This interpolation, however, depends on the world model (internal representation of the problem domain) developed by the learning method. Neural networks can be broadly classified into two categories: supervised and unsu- pervised networks. Adaptive methods that attempt to reduce the output error are supervised learning  methods, whereas those that develop internal representations without sample outputs are called unsupervised learning  methods. Neural networks self-adapt; that is, they learn from information about a specific problem. They perform well on classification tasks and are therefore useful in data mining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet they are not without problems. Although they learn, they do not pro-vide a good representation of what  they have learned. Their outputs are highly quantitative and not easy to understand. As another limitation, the internal repre-sentations developed by neural networks are not unique. Also, in general, neural networks have trouble modeling time series data. Despite these shortcomings, they are popular and frequently used by several commercial vendors. 28.5 Approaches to Other Data Mining Problems  1093\n",

A fitness function defines which solu- tions can survive and which cannot.\n",

They combine to produce a new generation of individu-als; the fittest individuals survive and mutate until a family of successful solu-tions develops.\n",
      "\n",
      "The solutions produced by GAs are distinguished from most other search techniques by the following characteristics: ■A GA search uses a set of solutions during each generation rather than a single solution. ■The search in the string-space represents a much larger parallel search in the space of encoded solutions. ■The memory of the search done is represented solely by the set of solutions available for a generation. ■A genetic algorithm is a randomized algorithm since search mechanisms use probabilistic operators.\n",

      "■While progressing from one generation to the next, a GA finds near-optimal balance between knowledge acquisition and exploitation by manipulating encoded solutions. Genetic algorithms are used for problem solving and clustering problems. Their ability to solve problems in parallel provides a powerful tool for data mining. The drawbacks of GAs include the large overproduction of individual solutions, the random character of the searching process, and the high demand on computer pro- cessing. In general, substantial computing power is required to achieve anything of significance with genetic algorithms.\n",

      "\n",
      " In Chapter 1, we defined a database  as a collection of related data and a database system  as a database and database software together. A data warehouse is also a col- lection of information as well as a supporting system. However, a clear distinction exists. Traditional databases are transactional (relational, object-oriented, network, or hierarchical). Data warehouses  have the distinguishing characteristic that they are mainly intended for decision-support applications. They are optimized for data retrieval, not routine transaction processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because data warehouses have been developed in numerous organizations to meet particular needs, there is no single, canonical definition of the term data warehouse . Professional magazine articles and books in the popular press have elaborated on the meaning in a variety of ways. Vendors have capitalized on the popularity of the term to help market a variety of related products, and consultants have provided a large variety of services, all under the data warehousing banner. However, data warehouses are distinct from traditional databases in their structure, functioning, performance, and purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "W. H. Inmon 1 characterized a data warehouse  as a subject-oriented, integrated, nonvolatile, time-variant collection of data in support of management’s decisions . Data warehouses provide access to data for complex analysis, knowledge discovery, and decision making through ad hoc  and canned queries. Canned queries  refer to a-priori  defined queries with parameters that may recur with high frequency. They support high-performance demands on an organization’s data and information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several types of applications—OLAP, DSS, and data mining applications—are sup-ported. We define each of these next. OLAP (online analytical processing)  is a term used to describe the analysis of complex data from the data warehouse. In the hands of skilled knowledge workers, OLAP tools enable quick and straightforward querying of the analytical data stored in data warehouses and data marts  (analytical databases similar to data warehouses but with a defined narrow scope).\n",
      "\n",
      "DSS (decision-support systems) , also known as EIS (or MIS)—executive information systems (or management information systems) , not to be confused with enterprise integration systems—support an organization’s leading decision makers with higher-level (analytical) data for complex and important decisions. Data mining (which we discussed in Chapter 28) is used for knowledge discovery , the ad hoc process of searching data for unanticipated new knowledge (not unlike looking for pearls of wisdom in an ocean of data).\n",
      "\n",
      "Traditional databases support online transaction processing (OLTP) , which includes insertions, updates, and deletions while also supporting information query requirements.

Thus, they cannot be optimized for OLAP, DSS, or data mining. By contrast, data warehouses are designed precisely to support efficient extraction, processing, and presentation for analytic and decision-making purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In comparison to traditional databases, data warehouses gener-ally contain very large amounts of data from multiple sources that may include databases from different data models and sometimes files acquired from indepen-dent systems and platforms.\n",

      "29.2 Characteristics of Data Warehouses   To discuss data warehouses and distinguish them from transactional databases calls for an appropriate data model. The multidimensional data model (explained in more detail in Section 29.3) is a good fit for OLAP and decision-support tech-nologies. In contrast to multidatabases, which provide access to disjoint and usually heterogeneous databases, a data warehouse is frequently a store of inte-grated data from multiple sources, processed for storage in a multidimensional model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike most transactional databases, data warehouses typically support time series and trend analyses along with what-if or predictive-type analyses, all of which require more historical data than is generally maintained in transac-tional databases. Compared with transactional databases, data warehouses are nonvolatile. This means that information in the data warehouse is typically not subject to modifica-tion and is often referred to as read/append/purge only. A data warehouse may be regarded as non–real-time with periodic insertions.\n",

      "\n",
      "The sheer volume of data (likely to be in terabytes or even petabytes) is an issue that has been dealt with through enterprise-wide data warehouses, virtual data warehouses, logical data warehouses, and data marts: ■Enterprise-wide data warehouses  are huge projects requiring massive investment of time and resources. ■Virtual data warehouses  provide views of operational databases that are materialized for efficient access.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Logical data warehouses  use data federation, distribution, and virtualiza- tion techniques. ■Data marts  generally are targeted to a subset of the organization, such as a department, and are more tightly focused. 3Codd and Salley (1993) coined the term OLAP  and mentioned the characteristics listed here.2Chaudhuri and Dayal (1997) provide an excellent tutorial on the topic, with this as a starting definition.\n",

      "29.3 Data Modeling for Data Warehouses Multidimensional models take advantage of inherent relationships in data to popu- late data in multidimensional matrices called data cubes . (These may be called hyper- cubes  if they have more than three dimensions.) For data that lends itself to multidimensional modeling, query performance in multidimensional matrices can be much better than in the relational data model. Three examples of dimensions in a corporate data warehouse are the corporation’s fiscal periods, products, and regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "A standard spreadsheet is a two-dimensional matrix. One example would be a spreadsheet of regional sales by product for a particular time period. Products could be shown as rows, with columns comprising sales revenues for each region. (Fig-ure 29.2 shows this two-dimensional organization.) Adding a time dimension, such as an organization’s fiscal quarters, would produce a three-dimensional matrix, which could be represented using a data cube.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 29.3 shows a three-dimensional data cube that organizes product sales data by fiscal quarters and sales regions.

      "\n",
      "By including additional dimensions, a data hypercube could be produced, although more than three dimensions cannot be easily visualized or graphically presented. The data can be queried directly in any combina-tion of dimensions, thus bypassing complex database queries. Tools exist for viewing data according to the user’s choice of dimensions. Changing from one-dimensional hierarchy (orientation) to another is easily accom- plished in a data cube with a technique called pivoting  (also called rotation ).\n",
      "\n",
      "In this technique, the data cube can be thought of as rotating to show a different orienta-tion of the axes. For example, you might pivot the data cube to show regional sales revenues as rows, the fiscal quarter revenue totals as columns, and the company’s products in the third dimension (Figure 29.4). Hence, this technique is equivalent to having a regional sales table for each product separately, where each table shows quarterly sales for that product region by region.\n",
      "\n",
      "The term slice  is used to refer to a two-dimensional view of a three- or higher-dimensional cube. The Product vs. Region 2-D view shown in Figure 29.2 is a slice of the 3-D cube shown in Figure 29.3. The popular term “slice and dice” implies a systematic reduction of a body of data into smaller chunks or views so that the information is made visible from mul- tiple angles or viewpoints.\n",

      "Shown in Fig- ure 29.6, a drill-down display  provides the opposite capability, furnishing a finer-grained view, perhaps disaggregating country sales by region and then regional sales by subregion and also breaking up products by styles. Typically, in a warehouse, the drill-down  capability is limited to the lowest level of aggregated data stored in the warehouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, compared to the data shown in Fig-ure 29.6, lower- level data will correspond to something like “the total sales for style P123 substyle A color Black in zipcode 30022 of sub-region 1.” That level of aggregation may have been kept in the ODS. Some DBMSs like Oracle offer the “nested table” concept, which enables access to lower levels of data and thus makes the drill-down penetrate deeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "The multidimensional model  (also called the dimensional model )-involves two types of tables: dimension tables and fact tables. A dimension table  consists of tuples of attributes of the dimension. A fact table  can be thought of as having tuples, one per a recorded fact. This fact contains some measured or observed variable(s) and identifies it (them) with pointers to dimension tables. The fact table contains the data, and the dimensions identify each tuple in that data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way to look at a fact table is as an agglomerated view of the transaction data whereas each dimension table represents so-called “master data” that those transactions belonged to. In multidimensional database systems, the multidimen-sional model has been implemented as specialized software system known as a multidimensional database , which we do not discuss. Our treatment of the multi- dimensional model is based on storing the warehouse as a relational database in an RDBMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 29.7 shows an example of a fact table that can be viewed from the perspective of multi-dimension tables. Two common multidimensional schemas are the star schema and the snowflake schema. The star schema  consists of a fact table with a single table for each dimension (Figure 29.7). The snowflake schema  is a variation on the star schema in which the dimensional tables from a star schema are organized .A fact constellation  is a set of fact tables that share some dimension tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 29.9 shows a fact constella-tion with two fact tables, business results and business forecast. These share the dimension table called product. Fact constellations limit the possible queries for the warehouse. Data warehouse storage also utilizes indexing techniques to support high- perfor mance access (see Chapter 17 for a discussion of indexing). A technique called bitmap indexing  constructs a bit vector for each value in a domain (column) being indexed. It works very well for domains of low cardinality.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a 1 bit placed in the jth position in the vector if the jth row contains the value being indexed. For example, imagine an inventory of 100,000 cars with a bitmap index on car size. If there are four car sizes—economy, compact, mid-size, and full-size—there will be four bit vectors, each containing 100,000 bits (12.5kbytes) for a total index size of 50K.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitmap indexing can provide considerable input/output and storage space advan- tages in low-cardinality domains. With bit vectors, a bitmap index can provide  dramatic improvements in comparison, aggregation, and join performance. We showed an example of a query on a star schema in Section 19.8, and we also showed the star schema’s transformation for efficient execution that uses bitmap indexes. In a star schema, dimensional data can be indexed to tuples in the fact table by join indexing . Join indexes are traditional indexes used to maintain relationships between primary key and foreign key values.\n",
      "\n",
      "They relate the values of a dimension of a star schema to rows in the fact table. Consider a sales fact table that has city and fiscal quarter as dimensions. If there is a join index on city, for each city the join index maintains the tuple IDs of tuples containing that city. Join indexes may involve multiple dimensions. Data warehouse storage can facilitate access to summary data by taking further advantage of the nonvolatility of data warehouses and a degree of predictability of the analyses that will be performed using them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two approaches have been used: (1) smaller tables that include summary data such as quarterly sales or revenue by product line, and (2) encoding of level (for example, weekly, quarterly, annual) into existing tables. The overhead of creating and maintaining such aggregations would likely be excessive in a dynamically changing, transaction-oriented database. The purpose of master data management (MDM) , a popular concept within enter- prises, is to define the standards, processes, policies, and governance related to the critical data entities of the organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dimension tables—which in a data warehouse physicalize concepts, such as customers, regions and product catego-ries—represent essentially the master data. Since dimensions are shared across multiple facts or reporting data marts, data warehouse designers typically must spend a considerable amount of time cleansing and harmonizing these dimensions (i.e., reconciling definitional and notional differences across multiple source sys-tems that the dimension data comes from). As such, table structures containing these dimensions become good candidates for special copies of master data that can be used in other environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "29.4 Building a Data Warehouse   In constructing a data warehouse, builders should take a broad view of the antici- pated use of the warehouse. There is no way to anticipate all possible queries or analyses during the design phase. However, the design should specifically support ad hoc querying ; that is, accessing data with any combination of values for the attributes that would be meaningful in the dimension or fact tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, a marketing-intensive consumer-products company would require different ways of organizing the data warehouse than would a nonprofit charity focused on fund raising. An appropriate schema should be chosen that reflects anticipated usage. Acquisition of data for the warehouse involves the following steps: 1. The data must be extracted from multiple, heterogeneous sources; for exam- ple, databases or other data feeds such as those containing financial market data or environmental data. 2. Data must be formatted for consistency within the warehouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Names, meanings, and domains of data from unrelated sources must be reconciled. For instance, subsidiary companies of a large corporation may have differ-ent fiscal calendars with quarters ending on different dates, making it diffi-cult to aggregate financial data by quarter. Various credit cards may report their transactions differently, making it difficult to compute all credit sales. These format inconsistencies must be resolved. 3. The data must be cleaned to ensure validity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data cleaning is an involved and complex process that has been identified as the largest labor-demanding component of data warehouse construction. For input data, cleaning must occur before the data is loaded into the warehouse. Since input data must be examined and formatted consistently, data warehouse builders should take this opportunity to check each input for validity and quality. Recognizing erroneous and incomplete data is difficult to automate, and cleaning that requires automatic error correction can be even tougher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some aspects, such as domain checking, are easily coded into data cleaning routines, but auto-matic recognition of other data problems can be more challenging. (For example, one might require that City = ‘San Francisco’ together with State  = ‘CT’ be recognized as an incorrect combination.) After such problems have been taken care of, similar data from different sources must be coordinated for loading into the warehouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "As data managers in the organization dis-cover that their data is being cleaned for input into the warehouse, they will likely want to upgrade their data with the cleaned data. The process of returning cleaned data to the source is called backflushing  (see Figure 29.1). 4. The data must be fitted into the data model of the warehouse. Data from the various sources must be represented in the data model of the warehouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data may have to be converted from relational, object-oriented, or legacy databases (network and/or hierarchical) to a multidimensional model. 5. The data must be loaded into the warehouse. The sheer volume of data in the warehouse makes loading the data a significant task. Monitoring tools 1112 Chapter 29 Overview of Data Warehousing and OLAP for loads as well as methods to recover from incomplete or incorrect loads are required.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the huge volume of data in the warehouse, incremental updating is usually the only feasible approach. The refresh policy will prob-ably emerge as a compromise that takes into account the answers to the fol-lowing questions: /box4How up-to-date must the data be? /box4Can the warehouse go offline, and for how long? /box4What are the data interdependencies? /box4What is the storage availability? /box4What are the distribution requirements (such as for replication and parti- tioning)?\n",
      "\n",
      "/box4What is the loading time (including cleaning, formatting, copying, trans- mitting, and overhead such as index rebuilding)? Data in a warehouse can come from multiple sources, geographies, and/or time zones. Data loads, therefore, need to be carefully planned and staged. The order in which data is loaded into the warehouse is critical; failure to load data in the correct order could lead to integrity constraints or semantic rule violations, both of which could cause load failures.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, master data (whether new or changed) such as Customer and Product must be loaded prior to the transactions that contain them; and invoice data must be loaded before the billing data that references it. As we have said, databases must strike a balance between efficiency in transaction processing and support for query requirements (ad hoc user requests), but a data warehouse is typically optimized for access from a decision maker’s needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data storage in a data warehouse reflects this specialization and involves the following processes: ■Storing the data according to the data model of the warehouse ■Creating and maintaining required data structures ■Creating and maintaining appropriate access paths ■Providing for time-variant data as new data are added ■Supporting the updating of warehouse data ■Refreshing the data ■Purging data Although adequate time can be devoted initially to constructing the warehouse, the sheer volume of data in the warehouse generally makes it impossible to simply reload the warehouse in its entirety later on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatives include selective (partial) refreshing of data and separate warehouse versions (which requires double storage capacity for the warehouse). When the warehouse uses an incremental data refresh-ing mechanism, data may need to be purged periodically; for example, a warehouse that maintains data on the previous twelve business quarters may periodically purge its data each year, or even each quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "29.4 Building a Data Warehouse  1113 Data warehouses must also be designed with full consideration of the environment in which they will reside. Important design considerations include the following: ■Usage projections ■The fit of the data model ■Characteristics of available sources ■Design of the meta-data component ■Modular component design ■Design for manageability and change ■Considerations of distributed and parallel architecture We discuss each of these in turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Warehouse design is initially driven by usage pro- jections; that is, by expectations about who will use the warehouse and how they will use it. Choice of a data model to support this usage is a key initial decision. Usage projections and the characteristics of the warehouse’s data sources are both taken into account. Modular design is a practical necessity to allow the warehouse to evolve with the organization and its information environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, a well-built data warehouse must be designed for maintainability, enabling the ware-house managers to plan for and manage change effectively while providing optimal support to users. You may recall the term meta-data  from Chapter 1; meta-data was defined as the description of a database; this description includes the database’s schema defini-tion. The meta-data repository  is a key data warehouse component. The meta-data repository includes both technical and business meta-data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first, technical meta-data , covers details of acquisition, processing, storage structures, data descriptions, warehouse operations and maintenance, and access support function-ality. The second, business meta-data , includes the relevant business rules and organizational details supporting the warehouse. The architecture of the organization’s distributed computing environment is a major determining characteristic for the design of the warehouse. There are two basic distributed architectures: the distributed warehouse and the federated ware-house.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a distributed warehouse , all the issues of distributed databases are rele- vant; for example, replication, partitioning, communications, and consistency concerns. A distributed architecture can provide benefits particularly important to warehouse performance, such as improved load balancing, scalability of perfor-mance, and higher availability. A single replicated meta-data repository would reside at each distribution site.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of the federated warehouse  is like that of the federated database: a decentralized confederation of autonomous data ware-houses, each with its own meta-data repository. Given the magnitude of the chal-lenge inherent to data warehouses, it is likely that such federations will consist of smaller scale components, such as data marts. Businesses are becoming dissatisfied with the traditional data warehousing tech- niques and technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "New analytic requirements are driving new analytic appli-ances; examples include Netezza of IBM, Greenplum of EMC, Hana of SAP, and 1114 Chapter 29 Overview of Data Warehousing and OLAP ParAccel of Tableau Software. Big data analytics have driven Hadoop and other specialized databases such as graph and key-value stores into the next generation of data warehousing (see Chapter 25 for a discussion of big data technology based on Hadoop).\n",

      "29.5  Typical Functionality of a Data Warehouse   Data warehouses exist to facilitate complex, data-intensive, and frequent ad hoc queries. Accordingly, data warehouses must provide far greater and more efficient query support than is demanded of transactional databases. The data warehouse access component supports enhanced spreadsheet functionality, efficient query processing, structured queries, ad hoc queries, data mining, and materialized views.\n",
      "\n",
      "In particular, enhanced spreadsheet functionality includes support for state-of-the-art spreadsheet applications (for example, MS Excel) as well as for OLAP applica-tions programs. These enhanced spreadsheet products offer preprogrammed functionalities such as the following: ■Roll-up (also drill-up). Data is summarized with increasing generalization (for example, weekly to quarterly to annually). ■Drill-down. Increasing levels of detail are revealed (the complement of roll-up). ■Pivot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cross tabulation (also referred to as rotation ) is performed. ■Slice and dice. Projection operations are performed on the dimensions. ■Sorting. Data is sorted by ordinal value. ■Selection. Data is filtered by value or range. ■Derived (computed) attributes. Attributes are computed by operations on stored and derived values. Because data warehouses are free from the restrictions of the transactional environ- ment, there is an increased efficiency in query processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the tools and techniques used are query transformation; index intersection and union; special ROLAP  (relational OLAP) and MOLAP  (multidimensional OLAP) functions; SQL extensions; advanced join methods; and intelligent scanning (as in piggy-backing multiple queries). There is also a HOLAP  (hybrid OLAP) option available that combines both ROLAP and MOLAP. For summary-type information, HOLAP leverages cube technology (using MOLAP) for faster performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "When detailed information is needed, HOLAP can “drill through” from the cube into the underlying relational data (which is in the ROLAP component). 4See the description of Cisco’s Data Virtualization Platform at http://www.compositesw.com/products- services/data-virtualization-platform/ 29.6 Data Warehouse versus Views  1115 Improved performance has also been attained with parallel processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parallel server architectures include symmetric multiprocessor (SMP), cluster, and mas-sively parallel processing (MPP), and combinations of these. Knowledge workers and decision makers use tools ranging from parametric queries to ad hoc queries to data mining. Thus, the access component of the data ware-house must provide support for structured queries (both parametric and ad hoc). Together, these make up a managed query environment. Data mining itself uses techniques from statistical analysis and artificial intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Statistical analysis can be performed by advanced spreadsheets, by sophisticated statistical analysis soft-ware, or by custom-written programs. Techniques such as lagging, moving aver-ages, and regression analysis are also commonly employed. Artificial intelligence techniques, which may include genetic algorithms and neural networks, are used for classification and are employed to discover knowledge from the data warehouse that may be unexpected or difficult to specify in queries. (We discussed data mining in detail in Chapter 28.)\n",
      "\n",
      "29.6 Data Warehouse versus Views   Some people consider data warehouses to be an extension of database views. Ear-lier we mentioned materialized views as one way of meeting requirements for improved access to data (see Section 7.3 for a discussion of views). Materialized views have been explored for their performance enhancement. In Section 19.2.4, we discussed how materialized views are maintained and used as a part of query optimization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Views, however, provide only a subset of the functions and capabili-ties of data warehouses. Views and data warehouses are similar in some aspects; for example, they both have read-only extracts from databases and they allow  orientation by subject. However, data warehouses are different from views in the following ways: ■Data warehouses exist as persistent storage instead of being materialized on demand. ■Data warehouses are not just relational views; they are multidimensional views with levels of aggregation.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Data warehouses can be indexed to optimize performance. Views cannot be indexed independent of the underlying databases. ■Data warehouses characteristically provide specific support of functionality; views cannot. ■Data warehouses provide large amounts of integrated and often temporal data, generally more than is contained in one database, whereas views are an extract of a database.\n",
      "\n",
      "■Data warehouses bring in data from multiple sources via a complex ETL process that involves cleaning, pruning, and summarization, whereas views are an extract from a database through a predefined query.1116 Chapter 29 Overview of Data Warehousing and OLAP\n",

      "29.7  Difficulties of Implementing   Data Warehouses Some significant operational issues arise with data warehousing: construction, administration, and quality control. Project management—the design, construc-tion, and implementation of the warehouse—is an important and challenging consideration that should not be underestimated. The building of an enterprise-wide warehouse in a large organization is a major undertaking, potentially taking years from conceptualization to implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of the difficulty and amount of lead time required for such an undertaking, the widespread develop-ment and deployment of data marts may provide an attractive alternative, espe-cially to those organizations with urgent needs for OLAP, DSS, and/or data mining support. The administration of a data warehouse is an intensive enterprise, proportional to the size and complexity of the warehouse. An organization that attempts to admin-ister a data warehouse must realistically understand the complex nature of its administration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although designed for read access, a data warehouse is no more a static structure than any of its information sources. Source databases can be expected to evolve. The warehouse’s schema and acquisition component must be expected to be updated to handle these evolutions. A significant issue in data warehousing is the quality control of data. Both quality and consistency of data—especially as it relates to dimension data, which in turn affects master data management—are major concerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the data passes through a cleaning function during acquisition, quality and consistency remain sig- nificant issues for the database administrator and designer alike. Melding data from heterogeneous and disparate sources is a major challenge given differences in nam-ing, domain definitions, identification numbers, and the like. Every time a source database changes, the data warehouse administrator must consider the possible interactions with other elements of the warehouse. Usage projections should be estimated conservatively prior to construction of the data warehouse and should be revised continually to reflect current requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "As utilization patterns become clear and change over time, storage and access paths can be tuned to remain optimized for support of the organization’s use of its ware-house. This activity should continue throughout the life of the warehouse in order to remain ahead of the demand. The warehouse should also be designed to accom-modate the addition and attrition of data sources without major redesign. Sources and source data will evolve, and the warehouse must accommodate such change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fitting the available source data into the data model of the warehouse will be a con-tinual challenge, a task that is as much art as science. Because there is continual rapid change in technologies, both the requirements and capabilities of the ware-house will change considerably over time. Additionally, data warehousing technol-ogy itself will continue to evolve for some time, so component structures and functionalities will continually be upgraded. This certain change is an excellent motivation for fully modular design of components.\n",
      "\n",
      "Review Questions  1117 Administration of a data warehouse will require far broader skills than are needed for traditional database administration. Often, different parts of a large organization view the data differently. A team of highly skilled technical experts with overlapping areas of expertise will likely be needed, rather than a single individual. The team must also pos-sess a thorough knowledge of the business and specifically the rules and regulations, the constraints and the policies of the enterprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like database administration, data ware-house administration is only partly technical; a large part of the responsibility requires working effectively with all the members of the organization who have an interest in the data warehouse. However difficult that can be at times for database administrators, it is that much more challenging for data warehouse administrators because the scope of their responsibilities is considerably broader than that faced by database administrators. Design of the management function and selection of the management team for a database warehouse are crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Managing the data warehouse in a large organiza-tion will surely be a major task. Many commercial tools are available to support management functions. Effective data warehouse management will be a team func-tion that requires a wide set of technical skills, careful coordination, and effective leadership.

      "■Policy issues at the governmental, institutional, or corporate level regarding what kinds of information should not be made publicly available—for example, credit ratings and personal medical records. ■System-related issues such as the system levels  at which various security functions should be enforced—for example, whether a security function should be handled at the physical hardware level, the operating system level, or the DBMS level.\n",

      "■The need in some organizations to identify multiple security levels  and to categorize the data and users based on these classifications—for example, top secret, secret, confidential, and unclassified. The security policy of the organization with respect to permitting access to various classifications of data must be enforced. Threats to Databases. Threats to databases can result in the loss or degradation of some or all of the following commonly accepted security goals: integrity, avail-ability, and confidentiality. ■Loss of integrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Database integrity refers to the requirement that informa- tion be protected from improper modification. Modification of data includes creating, inserting, and updating data; changing the status of data; and delet-ing data. Integrity is lost if unauthorized changes are made to the data by either intentional or accidental acts. If the loss of system or data integrity is not corrected, continued use of the contaminated system or corrupted data could result in inaccuracy, fraud, or erroneous decisions. ■Loss of availability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Database availability  refers to making objects available to a human user or a program who/which has a legitimate right to those data objects. Loss of availability  occurs when the user or program cannot access these objects. ■Loss of confidentiality. Database confidentiality refers to the protection of data from unauthorized disclosure. The impact of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information can range from violation of the Data Privacy Act to the jeopardization of national security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unauthorized, unanticipated, or unintentional disclosure could result in loss of public confidence, embar-rassment, or legal action against the organization. 1The substantial contributions of Fariborz Farahmand, Bharath Rengarajan, and Frank Rietta to this and subsequent sections of this chapter is much appreciated. 30.1 Introduction to Database Security Issues  1123 Database Security: Not an Isolated Concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "When considering the threats facing databases, it is important to remember that the database management sys-tem alone cannot be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data. Rather, the database works as part of a network of services, including applications, Web servers, firewalls, SSL terminators, and security moni-toring systems. Because security of an overall system is only as strong as its weakest link, a database may be compromised even if it would have been perfectly secure on its own merits.\n",
      "\n",
      "To protect databases against the threats discussed above, it is common to imple- ment four kinds of control measures : access control, inference control, flow control, and encryption. We discuss each of these in this chapter. In a multiuser database system, the DBMS must provide techniques to enable certain users or user groups to access selected portions of a database without gaining access to the rest of the database. This is particularly important when a large integrated database is to be used by many different users within the same organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, sensitive information such as employee salaries or performance reviews should be kept confidential from most of the database sys-tem’s users. A DBMS typically includes a database security and authorization subsystem  that is responsible for ensuring the security of portions of a database against unauthorized access. It is now customary to refer to two types of database security mechanisms: ■Discretionary security mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are used to grant privileges to users, including the capability to access specific data files, records, or fields in a specified mode (such as read, insert, delete, or update). ■Mandatory security mechanisms. These are used to enforce multilevel security by classifying the data and users into various security classes (or levels) and then implementing the appropriate security policy of the organi-zation.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, a typical security policy is to permit users at a certain classification (or clearance) level to see only the data items classified at the user’s own (or lower) classification level. An extension of this is role-based security,  which enforces policies and privileges based on the concept of orga- nizational roles. (See Section 30.4.2 for role based access control.) We discuss discretionary security in Section 30.2 and mandatory and role-based security in Section 30.3.\n",
      "\n",
      "30.1.2 Control Measures Four main control measures are used to provide security of data in databases: ■Access control ■Inference control ■Flow control ■Data encryption1124 Chapter 30 Database Security A security problem common to computer systems is that of preventing unauthor- ized persons from accessing the system itself, either to obtain information or to make malicious changes in a portion of the database. The security mechanism of a DBMS must include provisions for restricting access to the database system as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "This function, called access control , is handled by creating user accounts and passwords to control the login process by the DBMS. We discuss access control techniques in Section 30.1.3. Statistical databases  are used to provide statistical information or summaries of values based on various criteria. For example, a database for population statistics may provide statistics based on age groups, income levels, household size, educa-tion levels, and other criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Statistical database users such as government statis-ticians or market research firms are allowed to access the database to retrieve statistical information about a population but not to access the detailed confiden-tial information about specific individuals. Security for statistical databases must ensure that information about individuals cannot be accessed. It is sometimes possible to deduce or infer certain facts concerning individuals from queries that involve only summary statistics on groups; consequently, this must not be per-mitted either. This problem, called statistical database security , is discussed briefly in Section 30.4.\n",
      "\n",
      "The corresponding control measures are called inference control  measures. Another security issue is that of flow control , which prevents information from flowing in such a way that it reaches unauthorized users. Flow control is discussed in Section 30.6. Covert channels  are pathways on which information flows implic- itly in ways that violate the security policy of an organization. We briefly discuss some issues related to covert channels in Section 30.6.1.\n",
      "\n",
      "A final control measure is data encryption , which is used to protect sensitive data (such as credit card numbers) that is transmitted via some type of communications network. Encryption can be used to provide additional protection for sensitive por-tions of a database as well. The data is encoded  using some coding algorithm. An unauthorized user who accesses encoded data will have difficulty deciphering it, but authorized users are given decoding or decrypting algorithms (or keys) to deci-pher the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Encrypting techniques that are very difficult to decode without a key have been developed for military applications. However, encrypted database records are used today in both private organizations and governmental and mili-tary applications. In fact, state and federal laws prescribe encryption for any system that deals with legally protected personal information.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, according to Georgia Law (OCGA 10-1-911): “Personal information” means an individual’s first name or first initial and last name in combination with any one or more of the following data elements, when either the name or the data elements are not encrypted or redacted: /box4Social security number; /box4Driver’s license number or state identification card number; 30.1 Introduction to Database Security Issues  1125 /box4Account number, credit card number, or debit card number, if circum- stances exist wherein such a number could be used without additional identifying information, access codes, or passwords; /box4Account passwords or personal identification numbers or other access codes Because laws defining what constitutes personal information vary from state to state, systems must protect individuals’ privacy and enforce privacy measures adequately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Discretionary access control (see Section 30.2) alone may not suffice. Section 30.7 briefly discusses encryption techniques, including popular techniques such as public key encryption (which is heavily used to support Web-based transactions against databases) and digital signatures (which are used in personal communications). A comprehensive discussion of security in computer systems and databases is outside the scope of this text. We give only a brief overview of database security techniques here. Network- and communication-based security is also a vast topic that we do not cover.\n",

      "30.1.3 Database Security and the DBA As we discussed in Chapter 1, the database administrator (DBA) is the central authority for managing a database system. The DBA’s responsibilities include granting privileges to users who need to use the system and classifying users and data in accordance with the policy of the organization. The DBA has a DBA account in the DBMS, sometimes called a system  or superuser account , which provides powerful capabilities that are not made available to regular database accounts and users.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 DBA-privileged commands include commands for granting and revoking privileges to individual accounts, users, or user groups and for performing the fol-lowing types of actions: 1. Account creation. This action creates a new account and password for a user or a group of users to enable access to the DBMS. 2. Privilege granting. This action permits the DBA to grant certain privileges to certain accounts. 3. Privilege revocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This action permits the DBA to revoke (cancel) cer- tain privileges that were previously given to certain accounts. 4. Security level assignment. This action consists of assigning user accounts to the appropriate security clearance level. The DBA is responsible for the overall security of the database system. Action 1 in the preceding list is used to control access to the DBMS as a whole, whereas actions 2 and 3 are used to control discretionary  database authorization, and action 4 is used to control mandatory  authorization.\n",
      "\n",
      "2This account is similar to the root or superuser  accounts that are given to computer system administra- tors and that allow access to restricted operating system commands.1126 Chapter 30 Database Security\n",
      "\n",
      "30.1.4 Access Control, User Accounts, and Database Audits Whenever a person or a group of persons needs to access a database system, the individual or group must first apply for a user account. The DBA will then create a new account number  and password  for the user if there is a legitimate need to access the database. The user must log in  to the DBMS by entering the account number and password whenever database access is needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DBMS checks that the account number and password are valid; if they are, the user is permitted to use the DBMS and to access the database. Application programs can also be considered users and are required to log in to the database (see Chapter 10). It is straightforward to keep track of database users and their accounts and pass- words by creating an encrypted table or file with two fields: AccountNumber and Password. This table can easily be maintained by the DBMS. Whenever a new account is created, a new record is inserted into the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "When an account is can-celed, the corresponding record must be deleted from the table. The database system must also keep track of all operations on the database that are applied by a certain user throughout each login session , which consists of the sequence of database interactions that a user performs from the time of logging in to the time of logging off. When a user logs in, the DBMS can record the user’s account number and associate it with the computer or device from which the user logged in. All operations applied from that computer or device are attributed to the user’s account until the user logs off.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is particularly important to keep track of update operations that are applied to the database so that, if the database is tam-pered with, the DBA can determine which user did the tampering. To keep a record of all updates applied to the database and of particular users who applied each update, we can modify the system log. Recall from Chapters 20 and 22 that the system log  includes an entry for each operation applied to the database that may be required for recovery from a transaction failure or system crash.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can expand the log entries so that they also include the account number of the user and the online computer or device ID that applied each operation recorded in the log. If any tampering with the database is suspected, a database audit  is performed, which consists of reviewing the log to examine all accesses and operations applied to the database during a certain time period. When an illegal or unauthorized operation is found, the DBA can determine the account number used to perform the operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Database audits are particularly important for sensitive databases that are updated by many transactions and users, such as a banking database that can be updated by thousands of bank tellers. A database log that is used mainly for security purposes serves as an audit trail .\n",
      "\n",
      "30.1.5 Sensitive Data and Types of Disclosures Sensitivity of data  is a measure of the importance assigned to the data by its owner for the purpose of denoting its need for protection. Some databases con-tain only sensitive data whereas other databases may contain no sensitive data at all. Handling databases that fall at these two extremes is relatively easy because  30.1 Introduction to Database Security Issues  1127 such databases can be covered by access control, which is explained in the next section.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation becomes tricky when some of the data is sensitive whereas other data is not. Several factors can cause data to be classified as sensitive: 1. Inherently sensitive. The value of the data itself may be so revealing or con- fidential that it becomes sensitive—for example, a person’s salary or who a patient has HIV/AIDS. 2. From a sensitive source. The source of the data may indicate a need for secrecy—for example, an informer whose identity must be kept secret. 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Declared sensitive. The owner of the data may have explicitly declared it as sensitive. 4. A sensitive attribute or sensitive record. The particular attribute or record may have been declared sensitive—for example, the salary attribute of an employee or the salary history record in a personnel database. 5. Sensitive in relation to previously disclosed data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some data may not be sensitive by itself but will become sensitive in the presence of some other data—for example, the exact latitude and longitude information for a loca-tion where some previously recorded event happened that was later deemed sensitive. It is the responsibility of the database administrator and security administrator to collectively enforce the security policies of an organization. This dictates whether access should or should not be permitted to a certain database attribute (also known as a table column  or a data element ) for individual users or for categories of users.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several factors must be considered before deciding whether it is safe to reveal the data. The three most important factors are data availability, access acceptability, and authenticity assurance. 1. Data availability. If a user is updating a field, then this field becomes inac- cessible and other users should not be able to view this data. This blocking is only temporary and only to ensure that no user sees any inaccurate data. This is typically handled by the concurrency control mechanism (see Chapter 21). 2. Access acceptability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data should only be revealed to authorized users. A database administrator may also deny access to a user request even if the request does not directly access a sensitive data item, on the grounds that the requested data may reveal information about the sensitive data that the user is not authorized to have. 3. Authenticity assurance. Before granting access, certain external character- istics about the user may also be considered. For example, a user may only be permitted access during working hours. The system may track previous queries to ensure that a combination of queries does not reveal sensitive data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latter is particularly relevant to statistical database queries (see Section 30.5).1128 Chapter 30 Database Security The term precision , when used in the security area, refers to allowing as much as possible of the data to be available, subject to protecting exactly the subset of data that is sensitive. The definitions of security  versus precision  are as follows: ■Security:  Means of ensuring that data is kept safe from corruption and that access to it is suitably controlled.\n",
      "\n",
      "To provide security means to disclose only nonsensitive data and to reject any query that references a sensitive field. ■Precision:  To protect all sensitive data while disclosing or making avail- able as much nonsensitive data as possible. Note that this definition of pre- cision  is not related to the precision of information retrieval defined in Section 27.6.1. The ideal combination is to maintain perfect security with maximum precision. If we want to maintain security, precision must be sacrificed to some degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence there is typically a tradeoff between security and precision.\n",

      "30.1.6  Relationship between Information Security and Information Privacy The rapid advancement of the use of information technology (IT) in industry, govern- ment, and academia raises challenging questions and problems regarding the protec-tion and use of personal information. Questions of who has what  rights to information about individuals for which  purposes become more important as we move toward a world in which it is technically possible to know just about anything about anyone. Deciding how to design privacy considerations in technology for the future includes philosophical, legal, and practical dimensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a considerable overlap between issues related to access to resources (security) and issues related to appro-priate use of information (privacy). We now define the difference between security and privacy . Security  in information technology refers to many aspects of protecting a system from unauthorized use, including authentication of users, information encryption, access control, firewall policies, and intrusion detection. For our purposes here, we will limit our treatment of security to the concepts associated with how well a sys-tem can protect access to information it contains. The concept of privacy  goes beyond security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Privacy examines how well the use of personal information that the system acquires about a user conforms to the explicit or implicit assumptions regarding that use. From an end user perspective, privacy can be considered from two different perspectives: preventing storage  of personal information versus ensur- ing appropriate use  of personal information. For the purposes of this chapter, a simple but useful definition of privacy  is the abil- ity of individuals to control the terms under which their personal information is acquired and used .\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, security involves technology to ensure that infor- mation is appropriately protected. Security is a required building block for privacy. Privacy involves mechanisms to support compliance with some basic principles and other explicitly stated policies. One basic principle is that people should be informed  30.2 Discretionary Access Control Based on Granting and Revoking Privileges  1129 about information collection, told in advance what will be done with their informa- tion, and given a reasonable opportunity to approve or disapprove of such use of the information.\n",
      "\n",
      "A related concept, trust , relates to both security and privacy and is seen as increasing when it is perceived that both security and privacy are provided for.\n",
      "\n",
      "30.2  Discretionary Access Control Based   on Granting and Revoking Privileges The typical method of enforcing discretionary access control  in a database system is based on the granting and revoking of privileges . Let us consider privileges in the context of a relational DBMS. In particular, we will discuss a system of privileges somewhat similar to the one originally developed for the SQL language (see Chap-ters 7 and 8). Many current relational DBMSs use some variation of this technique.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main idea is to include statements in the query language that allow the DBA and selected users to grant and revoke privileges.\n",
      "\n",
      "30.2.1 Types of Discretionary Privileges In SQL2 and later versions,3 the concept of an authorization identifier  is used to refer, roughly speaking, to a user account (or group of user accounts). For simplic-ity, we will use the words user or account  interchangeably in place of authorization identifier. The DBMS must provide selective access to each relation in the database based on specific accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Operations may also be controlled; thus, having an account does not necessarily entitle the account holder to all the functionality pro-vided by the DBMS. Informally, there are two levels for assigning privileges to use the database system: ■The account level. At this level, the DBA specifies the particular privileges that each account holds independently of the relations in the database. ■The relation (or table) level. At this level, the DBA can control the privilege to access each individual relation or view in the database.\n",
      "\n",
      "The privileges at the account level  apply to the capabilities provided to the account itself and can include the CREATE SCHEMA  or CREATE TABLE  privilege, to create a schema or base relation; the CREATE VIEW  privilege; the ALTER  privilege, to apply schema changes such as adding or removing attributes from relations; the DROP privilege, to delete relations or views; the MODIFY  privilege, to insert, delete, or update tuples; and the SELECT  privilege, to retrieve information from the database by using a SELECT  query.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that these account privileges apply to the account in general. If a certain account does not have the CREATE TABLE  privilege, no rela- tions can be created from that account. Account-level privileges are not  defined as part of SQL2; they are left to the DBMS implementers to define. In earlier versions of SQL, a CREATETAB  privilege existed to give an account the privilege to create tables (relations).\n",
      "\n",
      "3Discretionary privileges were incorporated into SQL2 and are applicable to later versions of SQL.1130 Chapter 30 Database Security The second level of privileges applies to the relation level , which includes base rela- tions and virtual (view) relations. These privileges are defined for SQL2. In the fol- lowing discussion, the term relation  may refer either to a base relation or to a view, unless we explicitly specify one or the other. Privileges at the relation level specify for each user the individual relations on which each type of command can be applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some privileges also refer to individual columns (attributes) of relations. SQL2 commands provide privileges at the relation and attribute level only. Although this distinction is general, it makes it difficult to create accounts with limited privi-leges. The granting and revoking of privileges generally follow an authorization model for discretionary privileges known as the access matrix model , where the rows of a matrix M represent subjects  (users, accounts, programs) and the columns represent objects  (relations, records, columns, views, operations).\n",
      "\n",
      "Each position M(i, j) in the matrix represents the types of privileges (read, write, update) that sub- ject i holds on object j. To control the granting and revoking of relation privileges, each relation R in a database is assigned an owner account , which is typically the account that was used when the relation was created in the first place. The owner of a relation is given all privileges on that relation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In SQL2, the DBA can assign an owner to a whole schema by creating the schema and associating the appropriate authorization iden-tifier with that schema, using the CREATE SCHEMA  command (see Section 7.1.1). The owner account holder can pass privileges on any of the owned relations to other users by granting  privileges to their accounts. In SQL, the following types of privileges can be granted on each individual relation R: ■SELECT  (retrieval or read) privilege on R. Gives the account retrieval privi- lege.\n",
      "\n",
      "In SQL, this gives the account the privilege to use the SELECT  state- ment to retrieve tuples from R. ■Modification privileges on R. This gives the account the capability to mod- ify the tuples of R. In SQL, this includes three privileges: UPDATE , DELETE , and INSERT . These correspond to the three SQL commands (see Sec- tion 7.4) for modifying a table R. Additionally, both the INSERT  and UPDATE privileges can specify that only certain attributes of R can be modified by the account.\n",
      "\n",
      "■References privilege on R. This gives the account the capability to reference (or refer to) a relation R when specifying integrity constraints. This privilege can also be restricted to specific attributes of R. Notice that to create a view, the account must have the SELECT  privilege on all rela- tions  involved in the view definition in order to specify the query that corresponds to the view.\n",
      "\n",
      "30.2.2 Specifying Privileges through the Use of Views The mechanism of views  is an important discretionary authorization mechanism  in its own right. For example, if the owner A of a relation R wants another account B to be able to retrieve only some fields of R, then A can create a view V of R that  30.2 Discretionary Access Control Based on Granting and Revoking Privileges  1131 includes only those attributes and then grant SELECT  on V to B.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same applies to limiting B to retrieving only certain tuples of R; a view V′ can be created by defining the view by means of a query that selects only those tuples from R that A wants to allow B to access. We will illustrate this discussion with the example given in Section 30.2.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "30.2.3 Revoking of Privileges In some cases, it is desirable to grant a privilege to a user temporarily. For example, the owner of a relation may want to grant the SELECT  privilege to a user for a spe- cific task and then revoke that privilege once the task is completed. Hence, a mech-anism for revoking  privileges is needed. In SQL, a REVOKE  command is included for the purpose of canceling privileges.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will see how the REVOKE  command is used in the example in Section 30.2.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "30.2.4 Propagation of Privileges Using the GRANT OPTION Whenever the owner A of a relation R grants a privilege on R to another account B, the privilege can be given to B with  or without  the GRANT OPTION . If the GRANT OPTION  is given, this means that B can also grant that privilege on R to other accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose that B is given the GRANT OPTION  by A and that B then grants the privilege on R to a third account C, also with the GRANT OPTION . In this way, privileges on R can propagate  to other accounts without the knowledge of the owner of R. If the owner account A now revokes the privilege granted to B, all the privileges that B propagated based on that privilege should automatically be revoked by the system. It is possible for a user to receive a certain privilege from two or more sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, A4 may receive a certain UPDATE R privilege from both  A2 and A3. In such a case, if A2 revokes this privilege from A4, A4 will still continue to have the privilege by virtue of having been granted it from A3. If A3 later revokes the privilege from A4, A4 totally loses the privilege. Hence, a DBMS that allows propagation of privileges must keep track of how all the privileges were granted in the form of some internal log so that revoking of privileges can be done correctly and completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "30.2.5  An Example to Illustrate Granting and Revoking of Privileges Suppose that the DBA creates four accounts— A1, A2, A3, and A4—and wants only A1 to be able to create base relations. To do this, the DBA must issue the following GRANT  command in SQL: GRANT  CREATETAB TO A1; The CREATETAB  (create table) privilege gives account A1 the capability to create new database tables (base relations) and is hence an account privilege.\n",
      "\n",
      "This privi- lege was part of earlier versions of SQL but is now left to each individual system 1132 Chapter 30 Database Security implementation to define.

However, A1 does not want A2 to be able to propagate these privileges to additional accounts.

      "\n",
      "However, account A2 cannot grant INSERT  and DELETE  privileges on the EMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT tables because A2 was not given the GRANT OPTION  in the preceding command. Next, suppose that A1 wants to allow account A3 to retrieve information from either of the two tables and also to be able to propagate the SELECT  privilege to other accounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "A1 can issue the following command: GRANT  SELECT ON EMPLOYEE , DEPARTMENT TO A3 WITH GRANT OPTION ; The clause WITH GRANT OPTION  means that A3 can now propagate the privilege to other accounts by using GRANT .\n",

      "\n",
      "Next, suppose that A1 wants to give back to A3 a limited capability to SELECT  from the EMPLOYEE  relation and wants to allow A3 to be able to propagate the privilege. The limitation is to retrieve only the Name , Bdate , and Address  attributes and only for the tuples with Dno = 5.\n",

      "A1 then can create the following view: CREATE VIEW  A3EMPLOYEE AS SELECT  Name , Bdate , Address FROM  EMPLOYEE WHERE  Dno = 5 ; After the view is created, A1 can grant SELECT  on the view A3EMPLOYEE  to A3 as follows: GRANT  SELECT ON A3EMPLOYEE TO A3 WITH GRANT OPTION ; Finally, suppose that A1 wants to allow A4 to update only the Salary  attribute of EMPLOYEE ; A1 can then issue the following command: GRANT  UPDATE ON EMPLOYEE (Salary) TO A4; The UPDATE  and INSERT  privileges can specify particular attributes that may be updated or inserted in a relation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other privileges ( SELECT , DELETE ) are not attri- bute specific, because this specificity can easily be controlled by creating the appro- priate views that include only the desired attributes and granting the corresponding privileges on the views. However, because updating views is not always possible (see Chapter 8), the UPDATE  and INSERT  privileges are given the option to specify the particular attributes of a base relation that may be updated.\n",
      "\n",
      "30.2.6 Specifying Limits on Propagation of Privileges Techniques to limit the propagation of privileges have been developed, although they have not yet been implemented in most DBMSs and are not a part  of SQL. Limiting horizontal propagation  to an integer number i means that an account B given the GRANT OPTION  can grant the privilege to at most i other accounts. Vertical propagation  is more complicated; it limits the depth of the granting of privileges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Granting a privilege with a vertical propagation of zero is equivalent to granting the privilege with no GRANT OPTION . If account A grants a privilege to account B with the vertical propagation set to an integer number j > 0, this means that the account B has the GRANT OPTION  on that privilege, but B can grant the privilege to other accounts only with a vertical propagation less than j.\n",
      "\n",
      "In effect, vertical propagation limits the sequence of GRANT OPTIONS  that can be given from one account to the next based on a single original grant of the privilege. We briefly illustrate horizontal and vertical propagation limits—which are not available  currently in SQL or other relational systems—with an example. Suppose 1134 Chapter 30 Database Security that A1 grants SELECT  to A2 on the EMPLOYEE  relation with horizontal propaga- tion equal to 1 and vertical propagation equal to 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "A2 can then grant SELECT  to at most one account because the horizontal propagation limitation is set to 1. Addi-tionally, A2 cannot grant the privilege to another account except with vertical prop- agation set to 0 (no GRANT OPTION ) or 1; this is because A2 must reduce the vertical propagation by at least 1 when passing the privilege to others. In addition, the hori-zontal propagation must be less than or equal to the originally granted horizontal propagation.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if account A grants a privilege to account B with the horizontal propagation set to an integer number j > 0, this means that B can grant the privilege to other accounts only with a horizontal propagation less than or equal to j. As this example shows, horizontal and vertical propagation techniques are designed to limit the depth and breadth of propagation of privileges.\n",
      "\n",
      " The discretionary access control technique of granting and revoking privileges on relations has traditionally been the main security mechanism for relational data-base systems. This is an all-or-nothing method: A user either has or does not have a certain privilege. In many applications, an additional security policy  is needed that classifies data and users based on security classes. This approach, known as  mandatory access control (MAC) , would typically be combined  with the discre- tionary access control mechanisms described in Section 30.2.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that most mainstream RDBMSs currently provide mechanisms only for discretion ary access control. However, the need for multilevel security exists in government, mil-itary, and intelligence applications, as well as in many industrial and corporate applications. Because of the overriding concerns for privacy, in many systems the levels are determined by who has what access to what private information (also called personally identifiable information).\n",
      "\n",
      "Some DBMS vendors—for example, Oracle—have released special versions of their RDBMSs that incorporate manda-tory access control for government use. Typical security classes  are top secret (TS), secret (S), confidential (C), and unclas- sified (U), where TS is the highest level and U the lowest. Other more complex security classification schemes exist, in which the security classes are organized in a lattice.\n",
      "\n",
      "For simplicity, we will use the system with four security classification lev-els, where TS ≥ S ≥ C ≥ U, to illustrate our discussion. The commonly used model for multilevel security, known as the Bell-LaPadula model , 4 classifies each subject (user, account, program) and object  (relation, tuple, column, view, operation) into one of the security classifications TS, S, C, or U.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will refer to the clearance (classification) of a subject S as class( S) and to the classification  of an object O as class( O). Two restrictions are enforced on data access based on the subject/object classifications: 4Bell and La Padulla (1976) was a MITRE technical report on secure computer systems in Multics. 30.3 Mandatory Access Control and Role-Based Access Control for Multilevel Security  1135 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "A subject S is not allowed read access to an object O unless class( S) ≥ class( O). This is known as the simple security property . 2. A subject S is not allowed to write an object O unless class( S) ≤ class( O). This is known as the star property  (or *-property). The first restriction is intuitive and enforces the obvious rule that no subject can read an object whose security classification is higher than the subject’s security clearance. The second restriction is less intuitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "It prohibits a subject from writing an object at a lower security classification than the subject’s security clearance. Violation of this rule would allow information to flow from higher to lower classifications, which vio-lates a basic tenet of multilevel security. For example, a user (subject) with TS clear-ance may make a copy of an object with classification TS and then write it back as a new object with classification U, thus making it visible throughout the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "To incorporate multilevel security notions into the relational database model, it is common to consider attribute values and tuples as data objects. Hence, each attri-bute A is associated with a classification attribute  C in the schema, and each attribute value in a tuple is associated with a corresponding security classification. In addition, in some models, a tuple classification  attribute TC is added to the relation attributes to provide a classification for each tuple as a whole. The model we describe here is known as the multilevel model , because it allows classifications at multiple security levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "A multilevel relation  schema R with n attributes would be represented as: R(A 1, C1, A2, C2, … , An, Cn, TC) where each Ci represents the classification attribute  associated with attribute Ai. The value of the tuple classification attribute TC in each tuple t—which is the high- est of all attribute classification values within t—provides a general classification for the tuple itself. Each attribute classification Ci provides a finer security classification for each attribute value within the tuple.\n",
      "\n",
      "The value of TC in each tuple t is the high- est of all attribute classification values Ci within t. The apparent key  of a multilevel relation is the set of attributes that would have formed the primary key in a regular (single-level) relation. A multilevel relation will appear to contain different data to subjects (users) with different clearance levels. In some cases, it is possible to store a single tuple in the relation at a higher classifica-tion level and produce the corresponding tuples at a lower-level classification through a process known as filtering .\n",
      "\n",
      "In other cases, it is necessary to store two or more tuples at different classification levels with the same value for the apparent key. This leads to the concept of polyinstantiation , 5 where several tuples can have the same apparent key value but have different attribute values for users at different clearance levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "We illustrate these concepts with the simple example of a multilevel relation shown in Figure 30.2(a), where we display the classification attribute values next to each 5This is similar to the notion of having multiple versions in the database that represent the same real-world object.1136 Chapter 30 Database Security attrib ute’s value. Assume that the Name  attribute is the apparent key, and consider the query SELECT  * FROM  EMPLOYEE .\n",
      "\n",
      "A user with security clearance S would see the same relation shown in Figure 30.2(a), since all tuple classifications are less than or equal to S. However, a user with security clearance C would not be allowed to see the values for Salary  of ‘Brown’ and Job_performance  of ‘Smith’, since they have higher classification. The tuples would be filtered  to appear as shown in Figure 30.2(b), with Salary  and Job_performance appearing as null.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a user with security clearance U, the filtering allows only the Name  attribute of ‘Smith’ to appear, with all the other attributes appear- ing as null (Figure 30.2(c)). Thus, filtering introduces null values for attribute values whose security classification is higher than the user’s security clearance. In general, the entity integrity  rule for multilevel relations states that all attributes that are members of the apparent key must not be null and must have the same security classification within each individual tuple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, all other attribute values in the tuple must have a security classification greater than or equal to that of the apparent key. This constraint ensures that a user can see the key if the user is permitted to see any part of the tuple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other integrity rules, called null integrity and interinstance integrity , informally ensure that if a tuple value at some security level can be filtered (derived) from a higher-classified tuple, then it is sufficient to store the higher-classified tuple in the multilevel relation.Name Salary JobPerformance TC Smith U C 40000 S Fair S Smith U C 40000 C Excellent C Brown C S 80000 C Good SEMPLOYEE (d)Name Salary JobPerformance TC Smith U C 40000 S Fair S Brown C S 80000 C Good SEMPLOYEE (a) Name Salary JobPerformance TC Smith U C 40000 C NULL C Brown C C NULL C Good CEMPLOYEE (b) Name Salary JobPerformance TC Smith U U NULL U NULL UEMPLOYEE (c)Figure 30.2 A multilevel relation to  illustrate multilevel security.\n",

      "30.3 Mandatory Access Control and Role-Based Access Control for Multilevel Security  1137 To illustrate polyinstantiation further, suppose that a user with security clearance C tries to update the value of Job_performance  of ‘Smith’ in Figure 30.2 to ‘Excellent’; this corresponds to the following SQL update being submitted by that user: UPDATE  EMPLOYEE SET Job_performance  = ‘Excellent’ WHERE  Name  = ‘Smith’; Since the view provided to users with security clearance C (see Figure 30.2(b)) per- mits such an update, the system should not reject it; otherwise, the user could infer that some nonnull value exists for the Job_performance  attribute of ‘Smith’ rather than the null value that appears.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an example of inferring information through what is known as a covert channel , which should not be permitted in highly secure systems (see Section 30.6.1). However, the user should not be allowed to overwrite the existing value of Job_performance  at the higher classification level. The solution is to create a polyinstantiation  for the ‘Smith’ tuple at the lower clas- sification level C, as shown in Figure 30.2(d).\n",
      "\n",
      "This is necessary since the new tuple cannot be filtered from the existing tuple at classification S. The basic update operations of the relational model ( INSERT , DELETE , UPDATE ) must be modified to handle this and similar situations, but this aspect of the prob- lem is outside the scope of our presentation. We refer the interested reader to the Selected Bibliography at the end of this chapter for further details.\n",
      "\n",
      "30.3.1  Comparing Discretionary Access Control and Mandatory Access Control Discretionary access control (DAC) policies are characterized by a high degree of flexibility, which makes them suitable for a large variety of application domains. The main drawback of DAC models is their vulnerability to malicious attacks, such as Trojan horses embedded in application programs. The reason for this vulnerabil-ity is that discretionary authorization models do not impose any control on how information is propagated and used once it has been accessed by users authorized to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "By contrast, mandatory policies ensure a high degree of protection—in a way, they prevent any illegal flow of information. Therefore, they are suitable for military and high-security types of applications, which require a higher degree of protection. However, mandatory policies have the drawback of being too rigid in that they require a strict classification of subjects and objects into security levels, and therefore they are applicable to few environments and place an additional bur- den of labeling every object with its security classification.\n",
      "\n",
      "In many practical situa- tions, discretionary policies are preferred because they offer a better tradeoff between security and applicability than mandatory policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "30.3.2 Role-Based Access Control Role-based access control (RBAC) emerged rapidly in the 1990s as a proven tech- nology for managing and enforcing security in large-scale enterprise-wide systems. 1138 Chapter 30 Database Security Its basic notion is that privileges and other permissions are associated with organi- zational roles  rather than with individual users. Individual users are then assigned to appropriate roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roles can be created using the CREATE ROLE  and DESTROY ROLE  commands. The GRANT  and REVOKE  commands discussed in Section 30.2 can then be used to assign and revoke privileges from roles, as well as for individual users when needed. For example, a company may have roles such as sales account manager, purchasing agent, mailroom clerk, customer service manager, and so on. Multiple individuals can be assigned to each role.\n",
      "\n",
      "Security privileges that are com-mon to a role are granted to the role name, and any individual assigned to this role would automatically have those privileges granted. RBAC can be used with traditional discretionary and mandatory access controls; it ensures that only authorized users in their specified roles are given access to certain data or resources. Users create sessions during which they may activate a subset of roles to which they belong. Each session can be assigned to several roles, but it maps to one user or a single subject only.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many DBMSs have allowed the concept of roles, where privileges can be assigned to roles. Separation of duties is another important requirement in various mainstream DBMSs. It is needed to prevent one user from doing work that requires the involve- ment of two or more people, thus preventing collusion. One method in which sepa- ration of duties can be successfully implemented is with mutual exclusion of roles. Two roles are said to be mutually exclusive  if both the roles cannot be used simul- taneously by the user.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mutual exclusion of roles  can be categorized into two types, namely authorization time exclusion (static)  and runtime exclusion (dynamic) . In authorization time exclusion, two roles that have been specified as mutually exclu-sive cannot be part of a user’s authorization at the same time. In runtime exclusion, both these roles can be authorized to one user but cannot be activated by the user at the same time. Another variation in mutual exclusion of roles is that of complete and partial exclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The role hierarchy  in RBAC is a natural way to organize roles to reflect the organi- zation’s lines of authority and responsibility. By convention, junior roles at the bot-tom are connected to progressively senior roles as one moves up the hierarchy. The hierarchic diagrams are partial orders, so they are reflexive, transitive, and antisym-metric. In other words, if a user has one role, the user automatically has roles lower in the hierarchy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Defining a role hierarchy involves choosing the type of hierarchy and the roles, and then implementing the hierarchy by granting roles to other roles. Role hierarchy can be implemented in the following manner: GRANT ROLE  full_time TO employee_type1 GRANT ROLE  intern TO employee_type2 The above are examples of granting the roles full_time  and intern  to two types of employees. Another issue related to security is identity management . Identity  refers to a unique name of an individual person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the legal names of persons are not necessarily unique, the identity of a person must include sufficient additional information to  30.3 Mandatory Access Control and Role-Based Access Control for Multilevel Security  1139 make the complete name unique. Authorizing this identity and managing the schema of these identities is called identity management. Identity management addresses how organizations can effectively authenticate people and manage their access to confidential information. It has become more visible as a business require-ment across all industries affecting organizations of all sizes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Identity management administrators constantly need to satisfy application owners while keeping expen-ditures under control and increasing IT efficiency. Another important consideration in RBAC systems is the possible temporal con- straints that may exist on roles, such as the time and duration of role activations and the timed triggering of a role by an activation of another role. Using an RBAC model is a highly desirable goal for addressing the key security requirements of Web-based applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roles can be assigned to workflow tasks so that a user with any of the roles related to a task may be authorized to execute it and may play a certain role only for a certain duration. RBAC models have several desirable features, such as flexibility, policy neutrality, better support for security management and administration, and a natural enforce-ment of the hierarchical organization structure within organizations. They also have other aspects that make them attractive candidates for developing secure Web-based applications. These features are lacking in DAC and MAC models.\n",
      "\n",
      "RBAC models do include the capabilities available in traditional DAC and MAC policies. Furthermore, an RBAC model provides mechanisms for addressing the security issues related to the execution of tasks and workflows, and for specifying user-defined and organization-specific policies. Easier deployment over the Inter-net has been another reason for the success of RBAC models.\n",
      "\n",
      "30.3.3 Label-Based Security and Row-Level Access Control Many mainstream RDBMSs currently use the concept of row-level access control, where sophisticated access control rules can be implemented by considering the data row by row. In row-level access control, each data row is given a label, which is used to store information about data sensitivity. Row-level access control pro-vides finer granularity of data security by allowing the permissions to be set for each row and not just for the table or column.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially the user is given a default session label by the database administrator. Levels correspond to a hierarchy of data-sensitivity levels to exposure or corruption, with the goal of maintaining pri-vacy or security. Labels are used to prevent unauthorized users from viewing or altering certain data. A user having a low authorization level, usually represented by a low number, is denied access to data having a higher-level number. If no such label is given to a row, a row label is automatically assigned to it depending upon the user’s session label.\n",
      "\n",
      "A policy defined by an administrator is called a label security policy . Whenever data affected by the policy is accessed or queried through an application, the policy is automatically invoked. When a policy is implemented, a new column is added to each row in the schema. The added column contains the label for each row that 1140 Chapter 30 Database Security reflects the sensitivity of the row as per the policy. Similar to MAC (mandatory access control), where each user has a security clearance, each user has an identity in label-based security.\n",
      "\n",
      "This user’s identity is compared to the label assigned to each row to determine whether the user has access to view the contents of that row. However, the user can write the label value himself, within certain restrictions and guidelines for that specific row. This label can be set to a value that is between the user’s current session label and the user’s minimum level. The DBA has the privi-lege to set an initial default row label. The label security requirements are applied on top of the DAC requirements for each user.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, the user must satisfy the DAC requirements and then the label security requirements to access a row. The DAC requirements make sure that the user is legally authorized to carry on that operation on the schema. In most applica-tions, only some of the tables need label-based security. For the majority of the application tables, the protection provided by DAC is sufficient. Security policies are generally created by managers and human resources person- nel. The policies are high-level, technology neutral, and relate to risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Policies are a result of management instructions to specify organizational procedures, guiding principles, and courses of action that are considered to be expedient, prudent, or advantageous. Policies are typically accompanied by a definition of penalties and countermeasures if the policy is transgressed. These policies are then interpreted and converted to a set of label-oriented policies by the label security  administrator , who defines the security labels for data and authorizations for users; these labels and authorizations govern access to specified protected objects. Suppose a user has SELECT  privileges on a table.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the user executes a SELECT statement on that table, label security will automatically evaluate each row returned by the query to determine whether the user has rights to view the data. For example, if the user has a sensitivity of 20, then the user can view all rows having a security level of 20 or lower. The level determines the sensitivity of the information con-tained in a row; the more sensitive the row, the higher its security label value. Such label security can be configured to perform security checks on UPDATE , DELETE , and INSERT  statements as well.\n",

      "30.3.4 XML Access Control With the worldwide use of XML in commercial and scientific applications, efforts are under way to develop security standards. Among these efforts are digital signa-tures and encryption standards for XML. The XML Signature Syntax and Process-ing specification describes an XML syntax for representing the associations between cryptographic signatures and XML documents or other electronic resources. The specification also includes procedures for computing and verifying XML signa-tures.\n",
      "\n",
      "An XML digital signature differs from other protocols for message signing, such as OpenPGP  (Pretty Good Privacy —a confidentiality and authentication ser- vice that can be used for electronic mail and file storage application), in its support for signing only specific portions of the XML tree (see Chapter 13) rather than the  30.3 Mandatory Access Control and Role-Based Access Control for Multilevel Security  1141 complete document.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the XML signature specification defines mecha- nisms for countersigning and transformations—so-called canonicalization —to ensure that two instances of the same text produce the same digest for signing even if their representations differ slightly; for example, in typographic white space. The XML Encryption Syntax and Processing specification defines XML vocabulary and processing rules for protecting confidentiality of XML documents in whole or in part and of non-XML data as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The encrypted content and additional processing information for the recipient are represented in well-formed XML so that the result can be further processed using XML tools. In contrast to other commonly used tech-nologies for confidentiality, such as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer—a leading Internet security protocol) and virtual private networks, XML encryption also applies to parts of documents and to documents in persistent storage. Database systems such as PostgreSQL or Oracle support JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects as a data format and have similar facilities for JSON objects like those defined above for XML.\n",
      "\n",
      "30.3.5  Access Control Policies for the Web and Mobile Appplications Publicly accessible Web application environments present a unique challenge to database security. These systems include those responsible for handling sensitive or private information and include social networks, mobile application API servers, and e-commerce transaction platforms. Electronic commerce ( e-commerce ) environments are characterized by any trans- actions that are done electronically. They require elaborate access control policies that go beyond traditional DBMSs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conventional database environments, access control is usually performed using a set of authorizations stated by security officers or users according to some security policies. Such a simple paradigm is not well suited for a dynamic environment like e-commerce. Furthermore, in an e-com-merce environment the resources to be protected are not only traditional data but also knowledge and experience. Such peculiarities call for more flexibility in speci-fying access control policies. The access control mechanism must be flexible enough to support a wide spectrum of heterogeneous protection objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because many reservation, ticketing, payment, and online shopping systems pro- cess information that is protected by law, the security architecture that goes beyond simple database access control must be put in place to protect the information. When an unauthorized party inappropriately accesses protected information, it amounts to a data breach, which has significant legal and financial consequences. This unauthorized party could be an adversary that actively seeks to steal protected information or may be an employee who overstepped his or her role or incorrectly distributed protected information to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inappropriate handling of credit card data, for instance, has led to significant data breaches at major retailers. In conventional database environments, access control is usually performed using a set of authorizations stated by security officers. But in Web applications, it is all too 1142 Chapter 30 Database Security common that the Web application itself is the user rather than a duly authorized individual. This gives rise to a situation where the DBMS’s access control mecha-nisms are bypassed and the database becomes just a relational data store to the sys-tem.\n",
      "\n",
      "In such environments, vulnerabilities like SQL injection (which we cover in depth in Section 30.4) become significantly more dangerous bacause it may lead to a total data breach rather than being limited to data that a particular account is authorized to access. To protect against data breaches in these systems, a first requirement is a compre- hensive information security policy that goes beyond the technical access control mechanisms found in mainstream DBMSs. Such a policy must protect not only traditional data, but also processes, knowledge, and experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "A second related requirement is the support for content-based access control. Content-based access control  allows one to express access control policies that take the protection object content into account. In order to support content-based access control, access control policies must allow inclusion of conditions based on the object content. A third requirement is related to the heterogeneity of subjects, which requires access control policies based on user characteristics and qualifications rather than on specific and individual characteristics (for example, user Ids).\n",
      "\n",
      "A possible solu-tion that will allow better accounting of user profiles in the formulation of access control policies, is to support the notion of credentials. A credential  is a set of prop- erties concerning a user that are relevant for security purposes (for example, age or position or role within an organization). For instance, by using credentials, one can simply formulate policies such as Only permanent staff with five or more years of service can access documents related to the internals of the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "XML is expected to play a key role in access control for e-commerce applications 6 because XML is becoming the common representation language for document interchange over the Web, and is also becoming the language for e-commerce. Thus, on the one hand, there is the need to make XML representations secure by providing access control mechanisms specifically tailored to the protection of XML documents. On the other hand, access control information (that is, access control policies and user credentials) can be expressed using XML itself. The Directory Services Markup Language (DSML)  is a representation of directory service information in XML syntax.\n",
      "\n",
      "It provides a foundation for a standard for communicating with the directory services that will be responsible for providing and authenticating user credentials. The uniform presentation of both protection objects and access control policies can be applied to policies and credentials them-selves. For instance, some credential properties (such as the user name) may be accessible to everyone, whereas other properties may be visible only to a restricted class of users. Additionally, the use of an XML-based language for specifying cre-dentials and access control policies facilitates secure credential submission and export of access control policies.\n",

However, users are permitted to retrieve statistical information about the populations, such as averages, sums, counts, maxi-mums, minimums, and standard deviations. The techniques that have been devel-oped to protect the privacy of individual information are beyond the scope of this text.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will illustrate the problem with a very simple example, which refers to the relation shown in Figure 30.3. This is a PERSON  relation with the attributes Name , Ssn, Income , Address , City, State , Zip, Sex, and Last_degree . A population  is a set of tuples of a relation (table) that satisfy some selection condi- tion. Hence, each selection condition on the PERSON  relation will specify a particu- lar population of PERSON  tuples.\n",

      "For example, the condition Sex = ‘M’ specifies the male population; the condition ((Sex  = ‘F’) AND (Last_degree  = ‘M.S.’ OR Last_degree = ‘Ph.D.’) ) specifies the female population that has an M.S. or Ph.D. degree as their highest degree; and the condition City = ‘Houston’ specifies the population that lives in Houston. Statistical queries involve applying statistical functions to a population of tuples.\n",

It is the responsibility of a database management system to ensure the confidentiality of information about individuals while still providing useful statistical summaries of data about those individuals to users. Provision of privacy protection  of users in a statistical database is paramount; its violation is illustrated in the following example.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases it is possible to infer  the values of individual tuples from a sequence of statistical queries. This is particularly true when the conditions result in a popu-lation consisting of a small number of tuples.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an illustration, consider the fol-lowing statistical queries: Q1: SELECT COUNT  (*)FROM  PERSON WHERE  <condition >; Q2: SELECT AVG  (Income ) FROM  PERSON WHERE  <condition >; Now suppose that we are interested in finding the Salary  of Jane Smith, and we know that she has a Ph.D. degree and that she lives in the city of Bellaire, Texas.

Even if the result of Q1 on the preceding condition is not 1 but is a small number—say 2 or 3—we can issue statistical queries using the functions MAX , MIN, and AVERAGE  to identify the possible range of values for the Salary  of Jane Smith.\n",

      "The possibility of inferring individual information from statistical queries is reduced if no statistical queries are permitted whenever the number of tuples in the population specified by the selection condition falls below some threshold. Another technique for prohibiting retrieval of individual information is to prohibit sequences of queries that refer repeatedly to the same population of tuples. It is also possible to introduce slight inaccuracies or noise  into the results of statistical queries deliberately, to make it diffi- cult to deduce individual information from the results. Another technique is partition-ing of the database.\n",

      "Partitioning implies that records are stored in groups of some minimum size; queries can refer to any complete group or set of groups, but never to subsets of records within a group.

      "30.6 Introduction to Flow Control   Flow control  regulates the distribution or flow of information among accessible objects. A flow between object X and object Y occurs when a program reads values from X and writes values into Y. Flow controls  check that information contained in some objects does not flow explicitly or implicitly into less protected objects. Thus, a 1148 Chapter 30 Database Security user cannot get indirectly in Y what he or she cannot get directly in X. Active flow control began in the early 1970s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most flow controls employ some concept of security class; the transfer of information from a sender to a receiver is allowed only if the receiver’s security class is at least as privileged as the sender’s. Examples of a flow con-trol include preventing a service program from leaking a customer’s confidential data, and blocking the transmission of secret military data to an unknown classified user. A flow policy  specifies the channels along which information is allowed to move.\n",
      "\n",
      "The simplest flow policy specifies just two classes of information—confidential ( C) and nonconfidential ( N)—and allows all flows except those from class C to class N. This policy can solve the confinement problem that arises when a service program handles data such as customer information, some of which may be confidential. For example, an income-tax-computing service might be allowed to retain a customer’s address and the bill for services rendered, but not a customer’s income or deductions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Access control mechanisms are responsible for checking users’ authorizations for resource access: Only granted operations are executed. Flow controls can be enforced by an extended access control mechanism, which involves assigning a security class (usually called the clearance ) to each running program. The program is allowed to read a particular memory segment only if its security class is as high as that of the segment. It is allowed to write in a segment only if its class is as low as that of the segment. This automatically ensures that no information transmitted by the person can move from a higher to a lower class.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, a military pro-gram with a secret clearance can only read from objects that are unclassified and confidential and can only write into objects that are secret or top secret. Two types of flow can be distinguished: explicit flows , which occur as a consequence of assignment instructions, such as Y:= f(X 1,Xn,); and implicit flows , which are gen- erated by conditional instructions, such as if f(Xm+1, … ,  Xn) then Y:= f (X1,Xm).\n",
      "\n",
      "Flow control mechanisms must verify that only authorized flows, both explicit and implicit, are executed. A set of rules must be satisfied to ensure secure information flows. Rules can be expressed using flow relations among classes and assigned to information, stating the authorized flows within a system. (An information flow from A to B occurs when information associated with A affects the value of infor- mation associated with B. The flow results from operations that cause information transfer from one object to another.)\n",
      "\n",
      "These relations can define, for a class, the set of classes where information (classified in that class) can flow, or can state the spe-cific relations to be verified between two classes to allow information to flow from one to the other. In general, flow control mechanisms implement the controls by assigning a label to each object and by specifying the security class of the object. Labels are then used to verify the flow relations defined in the model.\n",

      "30.6.1 Covert Channels A covert channel allows a transfer of information that violates the security or the policy. Specifically, a covert channel  allows information to pass from a higher classification level to a lower classification level through improper means. Covert  30.7 Encryption and Public Key Infrastructures  1149 channels can be classified into two broad categories: timing channels and storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The distinguishing feature between the two is that in a timing channel  the infor- mation is conveyed by the timing of events or processes, whereas storage channels do not require any temporal synchronization, in that information is conveyed by accessing system information or what is otherwise inaccessible to the user. In a simple example of a covert channel, consider a distributed database system in which two nodes have user security levels of secret (S) and unclassified (U). In order for a transaction to commit, both nodes must agree to commit.\n",
      "\n",
      "They mutually can only do operations that are consistent with the *-property, which states that in any transaction, the S site cannot write or pass information to the U site. However, if these two sites collude to set up a covert channel between them, a transaction involving secret data may be committed unconditionally by the U site, but the S site may do so in some predefined agreed-upon way so that certain information may be passed from the S site to the U site, violating the *-property.\n",
      "\n",
      "This may be achieved where the transaction runs repeatedly, but the actions taken by the S site implicitly convey information to the U site. Measures such as locking, which we discussed in Chapters 21 and 22, prevent concurrent writing of the information by users with different security levels into the same objects, preventing the storage-type covert channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Operating systems and distributed databases provide control over the multiprogramming of operations, which allows a sharing of resources without the possibility of encroachment of one program or process into another’s memory or other resources in the system, thus preventing timing-oriented covert channels. In general, covert channels are not a major problem in well-implemented robust data-base implementations. However, certain schemes may be contrived by clever users that implicitly transfer information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some security experts believe that one way to avoid covert channels is to disallow programmers to actually gain access to sensitive data that a program will process after the program has been put into operation. For example, a programmer for a bank has no need to access the names or balances in depositors’ accounts. Program-mers for brokerage firms do not need to know what buy and sell orders exist for clients. During program testing, access to a form of real data or some sample test data may be justifiable, but not after the program has been accepted for regular use.\n",

AES introduces more possible keys, compared with DES, and thus takes a much longer time to crack. In present systems, AES is the default with large key lengths.\n",

We briefly outline the work required in a few important areas that researchers in data- base security are trying to address.\n",
      "\n",
      "30.9.1 Data Quality The database community needs techniques and organizational solutions to assess and attest to the quality of data. These techniques may include simple mechanisms such as quality stamps that are posted on Web sites. We also need techniques that provide more effective integrity semantics verification and tools for the assessment of data quality, based on techniques such as record linkage. Application-level recov- ery techniques are also needed for automatically repairing incorrect data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ETL (extract, transform, load) tools widely used to load data in data warehouses (see Section 29.4) are presently grappling with these issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "30.9.2 Intellectual Property Rights With the widespread use of the Internet and intranets, legal and informational aspects of data are becoming major concerns for organizations. To address these  30.10 Oracle Label-Based Security  1155 concerns, watermarking techniques for relational data have been proposed. The main purpose of digital watermarking is to protect content from unauthorized duplication and distribution by enabling provable ownership of the content.\n",
      "\n",
      "Digital watermarking has traditionally relied upon the availability of a large noise domain within which the object can be altered while retaining its essential properties. How-ever, research is needed to assess the robustness of such techniques and to investi-gate different approaches aimed at preventing intellectual property rights violations.\n",
      "\n",
      "30.9.3 Database Survivability Database systems need to operate and continue their functions, even with reduced capabilities, despite disruptive events such as information warfare attacks. A DBMS, in addition to making every effort to prevent an attack and detecting one in the event of occurrence, should be able to do the following: ■Confinement. Take immediate action to eliminate the attacker’s access to the system and to isolate or contain the problem to prevent further spread. ■Damage assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Determine the extent of the problem, including failed functions and corrupted data. ■Reconfiguration. Reconfigure to allow operation to continue in a degraded mode while recovery proceeds. ■Repair. Recover corrupted or lost data and repair or reinstall failed system functions to reestablish a normal level of operation. ■Fault treatment. To the extent possible, identify the weaknesses exploited in the attack and take steps to prevent a recurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of the information warfare attacker is to damage the organization’s opera- tion and fulfillment of its mission through disruption of its information systems. The specific target of an attack may be the system itself or its data. Although attacks that bring the system down outright are severe and dramatic, they must also be well timed to achieve the attacker’s goal, since attacks will receive immediate and con-centrated attention in order to bring the system back to operational condition, diagnose how the attack took place, and install preventive measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "To date, issues related to database survivability have not been sufficiently investi- gated. Much more research needs to be devoted to techniques and methodologies that ensure database system survivability.\n",
      "\n",
      "30.10 Oracle Label-Based Security   Restricting access to entire tables or isolating sensitive data into separate databases is a costly operation to administer. Oracle label security  overcomes the need for such measures by enabling row-level access control. It is available starting with Oracle Database 11g Release 1 (11.1) Enterprise Edition. Each database table or view has a security policy associated with it. This policy executes every time the table or view is queried or altered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Developers can readily add label-based access 1156 Chapter 30 Database Security control to their Oracle Database applications. Label-based security provides an adaptable way of controlling access to sensitive data. Both users and data have labels associated with them. Oracle label security uses these labels to provide security.\n",
      "\n",
      "30.10.1 Virtual Private Database (VPD) Technology   Virtual private databases (VPDs)  are a feature of the Oracle Enterprise Edition that add predicates to user statements to limit their access in a transparent manner to the user and the application. The VPD concept allows server-enforced, fine-grained access control for a secure application. VPD provides access control based on policies. These VPD policies enforce object- level access control or row-level security.\n",
      "\n",
      "VPD provides an application program- ming interface (API) that allows security policies to be attached to database tables or views. Using PL/SQL, a host programming language used in Oracle applications, developers and security administrators can implement security policies with the help of stored procedures. 9 VPD policies allow developers to remove access security mechanisms from applications and centralize them within the Oracle Database. VPD is enabled by associating a security “policy” with a table, view, or synonym.\n",
      "\n",
      "An administrator uses the supplied PL/SQL package, DBMS_RLS, to bind a policy function with a database object. When an object having a security policy associated with it is accessed, the function implementing this policy is consulted. The policy function returns a predicate (a WHERE  clause) that is then appended to the user’s SQL statement, thus transparently  and dynamically  modifying the user’s data access. Oracle label security is a technique of enforcing row-level security in the form of a security policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "30.10.2 Label Security Architecture   Oracle label security is built on the VPD technology delivered in the Oracle Data-base 11.1 Enterprise Edition. Figure 30.4 illustrates how data is accessed under Ora- cle label security, showing the sequence of DAC and label security checks. Figure 30.4 shows the sequence of discretionary access control (DAC) and label security checks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The left part of the figure shows an application user in an Oracle Database 11g Release 1 (11.1) session sending out an SQL request. The Oracle DBMS checks the DAC privileges of the user, making sure that he or she has SELECT privileges on the table. Then it checks whether the table has a virtual private data- base (VPD) policy associated with it to determine if the table is protected using Oracle label security.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it is, the VPD SQL modification ( WHERE  clause) is added to the original SQL statement to find the set of accessible rows for the user to view. Then Oracle label security checks the labels on each row to determine the subset of rows to which the user has access (as explained in the next section). This modified query is processed, optimized, and executed. 9Stored procedures are discussed in Section 8.2.2. 30.10 Oracle Label-Based Security  1157\n",
      "\n",
      "30.10.3 How Data Labels and User Labels Work Together   A user’s label indicates the information the user is permitted to access. It also deter- mines the type of access (read or write) that the user has on that information. A row’s label shows the sensitivity of the information that the row contains as well as the ownership of the information. When a table in the database has a label-based access associated with it, a row can be accessed only if the user’s label meets certain criteria defined in the policy definitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Access is granted or denied based on the result of comparing the data label and the session label of the user. Compartments allow a finer classification of sensitivity of the labeled data. All data related to the same project can be labeled with the same compartment. Compart-ments are optional; a label can contain zero or more compartments. Groups are used to identify organizations as owners of the data with corresponding group labels. Groups are hierarchical; for example, a group can be associated with a parent group.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a user has a maximum level of SENSITIVE , then the user potentially has access to all data having levels SENSITIVE , CONFIDENTIAL , and UNCLASSIFIED . This user has no access to HIGHLY_SENSITIVE  data. Figure 30.5 shows how data labels and user labels work together to provide access control in Oracle label security.\n",
      "\n",
      "As shown in Figure 30.5, User 1 can access the rows 2, 3, and 4 because his maxi- mum level is HS (Highly_Sensitive). He has access to the FIN (Finance) compart-ment, and his access to group WR (Western Region) hierarchically includes group Oracle User Request for Dat a in SQL WR_SAL (WR Sales). He cannot access row 1 because he does not have the CHEM (Chemical) compartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important that a user has authorization for all com-partments in a row’s data label so the user can access that row. Based on this exam-ple, user 2 can access both rows 3 and 4 and has a maximum level of S, which is less than the HS in row 2. So, although user 2 has access to the FIN compartment, he can only access the group WR_SAL and thus cannot access row 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "30.11 Summary   In this chapter, we discussed several techniques for enforcing database system security. Section 30.1 is an introduction to database security. We presented in Sec-tion 30.1.1 different threats to databases in terms of loss of integrity, availability, and confidentiality. We discussed in Section 30.1.2 the types of control measures to deal with these problems: access control, inference control, flow control, and encryption.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the rest of Section 30.1, we covered various issues related to secu-rity, including data sensitivity and type of disclosures; security versus precision of results when a user requests information; and the relationship between informa-tion security and privacy. Security enforcement deals with controlling access to the database system as a whole and controlling authorization to access specific portions of a database. The former is usually done by assigning accounts with passwords to users.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latter can be accomplished by using a system of granting and revoking privileges to individual accounts for accessing specific parts of the database. This approach is generally referred to as discretionary access control (DAC). We presented some SQL commands for granting and revoking privileges, and we illustrated their use with examples. Then in Section 30.3 we gave an over-view of mandatory access control (MAC) mechanisms that enforce multilevel security.\n",
      "\n",
      "These require the classifications of users and data values into security classes and enforce the rules that prohibit flow of information from higher to lower security levels. Some of the key concepts underlying the multilevel rela-tional model, including filtering and polyinstantiation, were presented. Role-based access control (RBAC) was introduced in Section 30.3.2, which assigns privileges based on roles that users play. We introduced the notion of role hierar-chies, mutual exclusion of roles, and row- and label-based security.\n",
      "\n",
      "We explained the main ideas behind the threat of SQL injection in Section 30.4, the methods in which it can be induced, and the various types of risks associated with it. Then we gave an idea of the various ways SQL injection can be prevented. We briefly discussed in Section 30.5 the problem of controlling access to statistical databases to protect the privacy of individual information while concurrently pro-viding statistical access to populations of records.\n",
      "\n",
      "The issues related to flow control and the problems associated with covert channels were discussed next in Sec-tion 30.6, as well as encryption and public-versus-private key-based infrastructures in Section 30.7. The idea of symmetric key algorithms and the use of the popular asymmetric key-based public key infrastructure (PKI) scheme was explained in Section 30.7.3. We also covered in Sections 30.7.4 and 30.7.5 the concepts of digital signatures and digital certificates.\n",
      "\n",
      "We highlighted in Section 30.8 the importance of privacy issues and hinted at some privacy preservation techniques. We discussed in Section 30.9 a variety of challenges to security, including data quality, intellectual property rights, and data survivability. We ended the chapter in Section 30.10 by introducing the implementation of security policies by using a combination of label-based security and virtual private databases in Oracle 11g.
